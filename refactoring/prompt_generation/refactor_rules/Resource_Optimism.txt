  Description: "Add an assertion to ensure that the required file or directory exists before performing operations on it, or give a hint if the test logic does not require file existence check."
  Steps:
    - Step:
        Description: "Check if the file existence is critical for the test, and add an assertion if necessary."
        Action: |
          If {fileVariable} requires existence check:
            AddAssertion
            Parameters:
              TargetPattern: |
                File {fileVariable} = ...;
              Assertion: |
                if (!{fileVariable}.exists() || {fileVariable}.isDirectory()) {
                    fail("File or directory does not exist or is not of the expected type.");
                }
          Else:
            ProvideHint
            Parameters:
              HintMessage: "The file existence is not critical for this test. Consider reviewing if a file check is necessary. For example, 'new File(\"\")' does not represent a real file."

  Example:
   Before: |
      @Test
      public void T() {
        File outputFile = ...;
        stmt
        assert
      }
    After: |
      @Test
      public void T() {
        File outputFile = ...;
        if (!outputFile.exists() || outputFile.isDirectory()) {
            // Hint: The file does not exist, but this may be expected behavior for the test.
        }
        stmt
        assert
      }
  Variables:
    fileVariable: "file"
