asserts result: 
 ```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

import com.google.gson.stream.JsonReader;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.StringReader;

class JsonReaderTest {

    @Test
    public void testNonStrictModeParsesUnescapedControlCharacter() throws IOException {
        String json = "\"\t\"";
        JsonReader reader = new JsonReader(new StringReader(json));
        assertThat(reader.nextString()).isEqualTo("\t");
    }
}
```

Note: The original test code did not actually contain an explicit `throw` or `catch` statement, so the refactoring primarily focuses on ensuring the test is clear and concise. However, if there were any exceptions to be expected, we would use JUnit 5's `assertThrows` method to handle it properly. In this case, no such exception handling is necessary as the test is straightforward and does not involve catching or throwing exceptions.
