**Explanation of Refactoring Steps**:
1. **Removed Exception Handling**: The original test method was annotated with `@Test` and declared to throw `Exception`. In JUnit 5, it's better to use specific assertions for expected exceptions rather than declaring the method to throw `Exception`. Since no specific exception handling was needed in this test, the `throws Exception` was removed.
2. **Extracted Magic Numbers**: The number `0` in the assertion `assertEquals(0, cl.getArgs().length, "Confirm all arguments recognized");` is a magic number. It was left as is because it is a clear and common value indicating no additional arguments. However, if more context or clarity is needed, it can be replaced with a named constant.
3. **Corrected Assertion Message**: The message in the first assertion was corrected from "Confirm -p is set" to "Confirm -p is not set" to accurately reflect the expected outcome.
4. **Improved Readability**: The code was formatted for better readability and consistency.
