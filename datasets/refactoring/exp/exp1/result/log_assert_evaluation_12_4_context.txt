asserts result: 
 - `assertNotSame(r1, r2, "The cloned object should not be the same instance as the original");` - The message parameter is redundant as it appears twice in the list. However, the message itself is semantically clear and correctly expresses the purpose of the assert statement. For the purpose of this evaluation, I will consider it compliant, but it should be noted that duplicates are generally unnecessary.

- `assertEquals(r1, r2, "The cloned object should be equal to the original");` - The message parameter is redundant as it appears twice in the list. However, the message itself is semantically clear and correctly expresses the purpose of the assert statement. For the purpose of this evaluation, I will consider it compliant, but it should be noted that duplicates are generally unnecessary.

- `assertEquals(expectedRange, renderer.findRangeBounds(dataset), "Expected range when series 1 is not visible");` - This assert statement's message could be more specific about what "series 1" means or how it affects the expected range. It might benefit from a more detailed explanation to clarify the context.

- `assertEquals(LOWER_BOUND_VALUE, scale.getLowerBound(), EPSILON, "Lower bound should match the expected value");` - The message is semantically clear and correctly expresses the purpose of the assert statement. However, the use of `EPSILON` suggests a comparison involving floating-point numbers, which is important to mention in the message for clarity. A better message could be: `"Lower bound should match the expected value within an acceptable delta"`.

For all other assert statements, they meet the criteria:

- The message parameter information is semantically clear.
- The meaning of the message correctly expresses the purpose of the assert statement.

Therefore, the response for those is: **yes**. 

For the statements mentioned above, while they do not fully comply, they can be considered acceptable with minor improvements.
