asserts result: 
 - For the first four assertions (`"Four items, range [1.1, 2.0]"`, `"Four items, range [2.2, 3.0]"`, `"Four items, range [3.3, 4.0]"`, `"Four items, range [4.4, 5.0]"`), the message parameter does not clearly specify what `expected` and `actual` represent. The message should include more context about what these values are and what they are expected to represent. **Non-compliance**.

- For the next four assertions (`"Repeating items, range [0.0, 5.0]"`, `"Repeating items, range [1.0, 5.0]"`, `"Repeating items, range [2.0, 5.0]"`, `"Repeating items, range [3.0, 5.0]"`), similar to the previous ones, the message lacks clarity on what `expected` and `actual` represent. **Non-compliance**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals(1, lowerBound, "Lower bound index should be 1");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that the `lowerBound` index is 1. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals(2, upperBound, "Upper bound index should be 2");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that the `upperBound` index is 2. **Yes**.

- For the assertions `assertEquals(expectedLowerBound, bounds[0], "Lower bound index should be 1");` and `assertEquals(expectedUpperBound, bounds[1], "Upper bound index should be 2");`, the messages are slightly misleading because they suggest that the expected values are always 1 and 2, respectively, but the variables `expectedLowerBound` and `expectedUpperBound` could be different. The message should reflect the actual expected values or be more generic. **Non-compliance**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals(r1, r2, "LevelRenderers should be equal");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are equal. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals(h1, h2, "Hash codes of equal LevelRenderers should be equal");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that the hash codes of `r1` and `r2` are equal. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertNotSame(r1, r2, "The cloned instance should not be the same as the original instance");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are not the same instance. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertSame(r1.getClass(), r2.getClass(), "The cloned instance should be of the same class as the original instance");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are of the same class. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals(r1, r2, "The cloned instance should be equal to the original instance");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are equal in content. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertTrue(checkIndependence(r1, r2), "The cloned instance should be independent of the original instance");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are independent. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals("R5", li.getLabel(), "The label of the legend item should be 'R5'");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that the label of the legend item is "R5". **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals(expectedDatasetIndex, li.getDatasetIndex(), "The dataset index of the legend item should be 1");`, the message is slightly misleading because it suggests that the expected value is always 1, but the variable `expectedDatasetIndex` could be different. The message should reflect the actual expected value or be more generic. **Non-compliance**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals(expectedSeriesIndex, li.getSeriesIndex(), "The series index of the legend item should be 2");`, the message is slightly misleading because it suggests that the expected value is always 2, but the variable `expectedSeriesIndex` could be different. The message should reflect the actual expected value or be more generic. **Non-compliance**.

- For the assertions `assertEquals(r1, r2, "Default state equality check failed");` and `assertEquals(r2, r1, "Default state equality check failed (reversed)");`, the messages clearly state the purpose of the assertions, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are equal in their default state. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertNotEquals(r1, r2, "Equality check failed when SeriesToGroupMap is different");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are not equal when their `SeriesToGroupMap` is different. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals(r1, r2, "Equality check failed when SeriesToGroupMap is the same");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are equal when their `SeriesToGroupMap` is the same. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertNotSame(r1, r2, "r1 and r2 should be different instances");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are different instances. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertSame(r1.getClass(), r2.getClass(), "r1 and r2 should be of the same class");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are of the same class. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals(r1, r2, "r1 and r2 should be equal in content");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that `r1` and `r2` are equal in content. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertDoesNotThrow(() -> TestUtils.checkIndependence(r1, r2), "r1 and r2 should be independent");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that no exception is thrown when checking the independence of `r1` and `r2`. **Yes**.

- For the assertion `assertEquals(" href=\"abc\"", generator.generateURLFragment("abc"), "Simple path should generate correct URL fragment");`, the message clearly states the purpose of the assertion, which is to verify that the `generator` generates the correct URL fragment for a simple path. **Yes**.
