asserts result: 
 - The first 10 assert statements meet both criteria: the message parameter information is semantically clear, and the message correctly expresses the purpose of the assert statement.

- For the 12th to 24th assert statements: These also meet both criteria as the messages are clear and express the purpose of the assert statements accurately.

- For the 25th assert statement: `assertEquals("Expected upper bound index for series with no items", expectedIndex, actualIndex);`
  - **Reason**: The message is clear but does not specify what the expected behavior is (e.g., what value `expectedIndex` should be). It would be more informative to include the expected value in the message.

- For the 26th assert statement: `assertEquals("Expected upper bound index for series with one item (range 0.0-1.1)", expectedIndex1, actualIndex1);`
  - **Reason**: The message is clear but lacks specificity about the expected value. It would be more helpful to include the expected value in the message.

- For the 27th assert statement: `assertEquals("Expected upper bound index for series with one item (range 2.0-2.2)", expectedIndex2, actualIndex2);`
  - **Reason**: The message is clear but lacks specificity about the expected value. It would be more helpful to include the expected value in the message.

- For the 28th assert statement: `assertEquals("Expected upper bound index for series with two items (range 0.0-1.0)", expectedIndex1, actualIndex1);`
  - **Reason**: The message is clear but lacks specificity about the expected value. It would be more helpful to include the expected value in the message.

In summary, the 25th to 28th assert statements could be improved by including the expected values in the message to make them more informative. All other assert statements meet the criteria.
