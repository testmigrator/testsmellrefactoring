asserts result: 
 - For the assert statement: `assertTrue(doc.select("meta[name=charset]").isEmpty(), "There should be no meta elements with name='charset' after updating the charset.");`
  - Reason: The message is misleading because it suggests that there should be no meta elements with `name='charset'`, but typically, a `<meta>` tag with `name='charset'` is used to specify the character encoding of the document. The assertion might be correct if the intent is to ensure that this specific `<meta>` tag does not exist after an update, but the message could be clearer about the context or the reason why this should not exist.

- For the assert statement: `assertEquals("dontTouch", selectedNode.attr("version"), "The version attribute should remain 'dontTouch'");`
  - Reason: The message is not semantically clear. It is not explicit about what `selectedNode` is or why the version attribute should remain `dontTouch`. A more descriptive message would help clarify the purpose of the assertion.

All other assert statements meet the criteria for both semantic clarity and correctness in expressing the purpose of the assertion.
