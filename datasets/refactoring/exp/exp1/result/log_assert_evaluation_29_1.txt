asserts result: 
 - For the assert statement `assertEquals("<p title=\\"&pi;\\">&pi; &amp; &lt; &gt; </p>", doc.body().html(), "Extended escape mode encoding should match expected HTML output.");`, the message could be clearer. The term "Extended escape mode" might not clearly convey the specific condition or context under which this assertion is being made. A more descriptive message would help clarify the expected behavior.

All other assert statements meet the criteria of having semantically clear messages that correctly express the purpose of the assert statement. Therefore, the response for these is "yes".
