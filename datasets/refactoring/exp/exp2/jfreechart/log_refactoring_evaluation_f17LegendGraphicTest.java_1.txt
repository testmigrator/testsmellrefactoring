asserts result: 
 The refactored tests are consistent with the original test in terms of functionality. The original test checks both the equality of two `LegendGraphic` objects and the equality of their hash codes. The refactored version splits this into two separate tests, but each test still performs the same checks as the original:

1. **testHashcode_Equality**: This test checks if `g1` and `g2` are equal, which is consistent with the first `assertEquals` call in the original test.
2. **testHashcode_HashCodeEquality**: This test checks if the hash codes of `g1` and `g2` are equal, which is consistent with the second `assertEquals` call in the original test.

The `setupTestHashcode` method is used to initialize the `LegendGraphic` objects, but it does not affect the functionality of the tests. Therefore, the refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test.

**Answer: yes**
