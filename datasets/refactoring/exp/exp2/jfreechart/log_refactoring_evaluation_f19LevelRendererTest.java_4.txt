asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily cosmetic and structural, improving readability and maintainability without altering the behavior of the test. The setup of datasets, the creation of the renderer and plot, and the assertions remain consistent. The only additions are the use of meaningful variable names for the expected values and more descriptive assertion messages, which do not change the functional outcome of the test.
