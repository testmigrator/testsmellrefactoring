asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original and refactored tests is consistent. The refactored test uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to verify that no exception is thrown during the execution of the code block, which is equivalent to the original test's approach of setting a `success` flag and asserting it at the end. Both tests ensure that the code executes without throwing an exception.
