asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test `testDrawWithNullQ1` maintains the same functionality as the original test. Both tests aim to verify that the creation of a buffered image from a `JFreeChart` object does not throw an exception when the dataset contains a `null` value for the first quartile (`Q1`). The refactored version uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to simplify the exception handling, but the overall behavior and intent of the test remain unchanged.
