asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. Both the original and refactored versions check that two `LevelRenderer` objects are equal and that their hash codes are equal. The refactored version splits the checks into two separate test methods, but the overall functionality remains the same.

**Response:**
yes
