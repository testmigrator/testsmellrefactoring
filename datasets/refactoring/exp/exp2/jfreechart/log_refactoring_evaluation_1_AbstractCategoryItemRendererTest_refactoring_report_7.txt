asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks both the cloning of the `BarRenderer` instance and the cloning of the `LegendItemURLGenerator`. The refactored version splits these checks into two separate tests, but each test still verifies the same conditions:

1. **testCloning_LegendItemURLGenerator_Instances**: This test checks that the `BarRenderer` instances `r1` and `r2` are different, of the same class, and equal.
2. **testCloning_LegendItemURLGenerator_GeneratorCloning**: This test checks that the `LegendItemURLGenerator` instances associated with `r1` and `r2` are different.

Both sets of tests ensure that the cloning process works correctly and that the `LegendItemURLGenerator` is also cloned properly. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
