asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks for equality and inequality of `StatisticalLineAndShapeRenderer` instances under different conditions, and the refactored tests do the same:

1. **Equality of Default Instances**: Both the original and refactored tests check if two default instances (`r1` and `r2`) are equal.
2. **Inequality After Modifying One Instance**: Both tests check that the instances are not equal after setting a different `errorIndicatorPaint` on one instance.
3. **Equality After Setting the Same Property**: Both tests check that the instances are equal again after setting the same `errorIndicatorPaint` on both instances.

The refactored tests achieve this through more granular test methods, but the overall functionality remains consistent.
