asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version splits the original single test into two separate tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `StatisticalLineAndShapeRenderer` class: equality and hash code equality. Both aspects are still being tested, and the expected behavior remains the same.

Therefore, the answer is: **yes**.
