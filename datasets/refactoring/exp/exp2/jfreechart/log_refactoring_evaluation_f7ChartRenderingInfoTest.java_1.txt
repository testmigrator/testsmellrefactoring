asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each aspect of the `testEquals` method from the original test has been broken down into individual test methods, each focusing on a specific condition or state change. The assertions and the logic used to test the equality of `ChartRenderingInfo` objects under different conditions are preserved, ensuring that the refactored tests cover the same scenarios as the original test.
