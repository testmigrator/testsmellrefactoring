asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version breaks down the original single test into three separate tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of the serialization process:

1. **testSerialization_Equality**: Checks if the serialized and deserialized objects are equal.
2. **testSerialization_NotSameInstance**: Ensures that the serialized and deserialized objects are not the same instance.
3. **testSerialization_Independence**: Verifies that the serialized and deserialized objects are independent.

Each of these tests performs the same setup and assertions as the original test, ensuring that the overall functionality remains the same.

**Answer: yes**
