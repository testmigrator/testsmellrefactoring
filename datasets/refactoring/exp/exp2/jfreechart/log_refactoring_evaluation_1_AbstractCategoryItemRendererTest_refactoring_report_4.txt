asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test `testCloning2` is split into two separate tests: `testCloningWithDefaultItemLabelGenerator` and `testCloningWithSeriesItemLabelGenerator`. Each of these tests checks the cloning behavior of `BarRenderer` objects with different configurations, which is consistent with the original test. The assertions used in the refactored tests are also equivalent to those in the original test, ensuring that the objects are not the same, belong to the same class, and are equal in value.
