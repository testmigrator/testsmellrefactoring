asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original single test method has been broken down into four separate methods, each focusing on a specific aspect of the cloning process:

1. **testCloning_InstancesAreDifferent**: Ensures that the cloned instances are different objects.
2. **testCloning_ClassTypesMatch**: Ensures that the cloned instance has the same class type as the original.
3. **testCloning_ContentsAreEqual**: Ensures that the cloned instance has the same content as the original.
4. **testCloning_ObjectsAreIndependent**: Ensures that the cloned objects are independent of each other.

Each of these tests corresponds to a part of the original test, and together they cover the same functionality. The use of `setupBarRenderer` to create the initial `BarRenderer` object ensures consistency across the tests.
