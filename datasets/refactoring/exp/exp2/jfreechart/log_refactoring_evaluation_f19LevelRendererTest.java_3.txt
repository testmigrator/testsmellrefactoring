asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test method `testDrawWithNullInfo` maintains the same functionality as the original test method. Both methods aim to ensure that no `NullPointerException` is thrown when creating a buffered image from a `JFreeChart` object. The refactored version uses the `assertDoesNotThrow` method from a testing framework (likely JUnit 5) to achieve this, which is functionally equivalent to the original try-catch block used to fail the test if an exception is thrown.
