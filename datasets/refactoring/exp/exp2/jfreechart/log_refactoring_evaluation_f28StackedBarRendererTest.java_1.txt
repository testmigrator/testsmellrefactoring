asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version breaks down the original test into more specific scenarios but maintains the same logical flow and assertions:

1. **Default State Equality**: Both the original and refactored tests check that two `StackedBarRenderer` instances are equal by default.
2. **Different Render As Percentages**: Both tests verify that setting `renderAsPercentages` to `true` on one instance makes it unequal to the other.
3. **Same Render As Percentages**: Both tests confirm that setting `renderAsPercentages` to `true` on both instances makes them equal again.

The refactored tests also provide clearer and more descriptive test names and messages, enhancing readability and maintainability without altering the core functionality.
