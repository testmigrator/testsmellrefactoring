asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test `testCloning` has been broken down into four separate tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of the cloning process:

1. **Instance Equality (`testCloning_InstanceEquality`)**: Ensures that `r1` and `r2` are different instances.
2. **Class Equality (`testCloning_ClassEquality`)**: Ensures that `r1` and `r2` are of the same class.
3. **Object Equality (`testCloning_ObjectEquality`)**: Ensures that `r1` and `r2` are equal in content.
4. **Independence (`testCloning_Independence`)**: Ensures that `r1` and `r2` are independent of each other.

Each of these tests covers a part of the original test, ensuring that all the assertions from the original test are still being checked. The functionality remains consistent.
