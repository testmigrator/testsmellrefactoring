asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test `testCloning` has been split into two separate tests: `testCloning_InstanceEquality` and `testCloning_Independence`. Each of these tests checks specific aspects of the cloning process, ensuring that the instances are not the same, are of the same class, are equal, and are independent. The `setupTestCloning` method is used to initialize the `LevelRenderer` object, which is then used in both tests, maintaining the consistency of the original functionality.
