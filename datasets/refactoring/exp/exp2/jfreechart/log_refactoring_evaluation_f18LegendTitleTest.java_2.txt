asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test `testCloning` has been broken down into four separate tests that each focus on a specific aspect of the cloning process:

1. **testCloning_InstancesAreDifferent**: Ensures that `t1` and `t2` are different instances.
2. **testCloning_ClassesAreEqual**: Ensures that `t1` and `t2` are of the same class.
3. **testCloning_InitialEquality**: Ensures that `t1` and `t2` are equal immediately after cloning.
4. **testCloning_Independence**: Ensures that `t1` and `t2` are independent objects, meaning changes to one do not affect the other.

Each of these tests corresponds to a part of the original test, and together they cover all the checks performed in the original test. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
