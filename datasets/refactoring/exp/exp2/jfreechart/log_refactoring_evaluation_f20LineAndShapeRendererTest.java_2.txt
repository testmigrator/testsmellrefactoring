asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original and refactored test code is consistent. The refactored code introduces more descriptive assertions using lambda expressions and custom messages, but it maintains the same logical steps and checks as the original test. Both versions ensure that:

1. The clone operation does not throw an exception.
2. The cloned object (`r2`) is not the same instance as the original (`r1`).
3. The cloned object has the same class as the original.
4. The cloned object is equal to the original.
5. The cloned object is independent of the original.

The additional custom messages in the refactored version provide better context in case of failures, but do not change the overall behavior or functionality of the test.
