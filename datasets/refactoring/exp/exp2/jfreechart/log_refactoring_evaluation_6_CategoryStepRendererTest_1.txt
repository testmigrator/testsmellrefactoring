asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. Each scenario in the original test is covered by a corresponding refactored test method:

- `testEquals_SameState` covers the case where two `CategoryStepRenderer` objects are created with the same state (`false`), and they should be equal.
- `testEquals_DifferentState` covers the case where two `CategoryStepRenderer` objects are created with different states (`true` and `false`), and they should not be equal.
- `testEquals_SameActiveState` covers the case where two `CategoryStepRenderer` objects are created with the same active state (`true`), and they should be equal.

All scenarios from the original test are represented in the refactored version, and the expected behavior is preserved. Therefore, the answer is:

**yes**
