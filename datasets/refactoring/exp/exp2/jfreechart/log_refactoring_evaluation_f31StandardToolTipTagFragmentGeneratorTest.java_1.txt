asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored code splits the original single test into two separate tests, each focusing on a specific case (simple string and complex string), but both cases are still being tested with the same expected outcomes. The introduction of the `setupTestGenerateURLFragment` method does not alter the behavior or the expected results of the tests.
