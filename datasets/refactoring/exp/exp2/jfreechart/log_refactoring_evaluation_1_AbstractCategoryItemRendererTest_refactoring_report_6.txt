asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks for the following:

1. `r1` and `r2` are different instances.
2. `r1` and `r2` are of the same class.
3. `r1` and `r2` are equal.
4. The `LegendItemToolTipGenerator` of `r1` and `r2` are different instances.

The refactored tests split these checks into two separate methods but still perform all the same assertions. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
