asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is **not** consistent. Here's why:

1. **Redundant Object Creation**: In the refactored tests, `p1` and `p2` are created twice. Once in `setupTestHashcode()` and again within each test method. This is redundant and unnecessary.

2. **Inconsistent State**: The objects `p1` and `p2` created in `setupTestHashcode()` are not used in the test methods. Instead, new objects are created, which means the setup method does not contribute to the test state.

3. **Potential for Different Behavior**: If `GradientBarPainter` has side effects or state that affects its behavior (e.g., if it uses a random number generator or maintains internal state), creating new objects in each test method could lead to different behavior compared to the original test, where the same objects were used throughout.

To make the refactored tests consistent with the original, you should use the objects created in `setupTestHashcode()` directly in the test methods:

```java
private GradientBarPainter p1, p2;

private void setupTestHashcode() {
    p1 = new GradientBarPainter(0.1, 0.2, 0.3);
    p2 = new GradientBarPainter(0.1, 0.2, 0.3);
}

@Test
public void testHashcode_Equality() {
    setupTestHashcode();
    assertEquals(p1, p2, "Objects should be equal");
}

@Test
public void testHashcode_HashCodeEquality() {
    setupTestHashcode();
    int h1 = p1.hashCode();
    int h2 = p2.hashCode();
    assertEquals(h1, h2, "Hash codes should be equal");
}
```

This way, the objects are created once in the setup method and used in both test methods, maintaining the consistency with the original test.
