asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The changes include:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The creation of the `OverLIBToolTipTagFragmentGenerator` instance is moved to a setup method (`setupTestGenerateURLFragment`) annotated with `@Before`, which ensures that this instance is created before each test method runs.
2. **Test Method Splitting**: The original single test method is split into two separate methods, `testGenerateURLFragment_SimpleText` and `testGenerateURLFragment_EscapedCharacters`, each focusing on a specific aspect of the functionality.
3. **Descriptive Assertions**: Each assertion now includes a descriptive message, which can help in understanding the purpose of the test when it fails.

These changes do not alter the core functionality being tested; they only improve the structure and readability of the tests. Therefore, the functionality remains consistent.
