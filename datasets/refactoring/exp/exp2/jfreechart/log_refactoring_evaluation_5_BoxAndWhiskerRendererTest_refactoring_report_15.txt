asserts result: 
 Yes

The original test and the refactored test both aim to verify that the `createBufferedImage` method does not throw an exception when called with a `DefaultBoxAndWhiskerCategoryDataset` that includes a `BoxAndWhiskerItem` with a null maximum outlier. The refactored version uses `assertDoesNotThrow` from JUnit 5, which is a more concise way to express the same intention as the try-catch block in the original test. Both tests will pass if no exception is thrown during the execution of the `createBufferedImage` method, and they will fail if an exception is thrown. Therefore, the functionality remains consistent between the two versions.
