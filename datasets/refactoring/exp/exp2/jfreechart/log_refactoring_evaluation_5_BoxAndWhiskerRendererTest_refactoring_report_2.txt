asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The primary changes are:

1. **Exception Handling**: The refactored test uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure that no `CloneNotSupportedException` is thrown during the cloning process. This is a more modern and expressive way to handle exceptions in JUnit tests.

2. **Assertion Messages**: The refactored test includes detailed messages for each assertion, which can help in understanding the failure when a test fails.

3. **Code Structure**: The refactored test wraps the entire cloning and assertion logic inside a lambda passed to `assertDoesNotThrow`, which makes the test more concise and readable.

These changes do not alter the core functionality of the test, which is to verify that the cloning process produces an independent and equal copy of the original `BoxAndWhiskerRenderer` object. Therefore, the functionality is consistent between the original and refactored tests.
