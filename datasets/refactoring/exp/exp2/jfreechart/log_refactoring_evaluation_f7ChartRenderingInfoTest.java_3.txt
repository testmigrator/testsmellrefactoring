asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version splits the original test into two separate tests (`testSerialization2_Equality` and `testSerialization2_OwnerEquality`) to make the assertions clearer and more specific. However, both the original and refactored versions perform the same checks:

1. **Equality Check**: Both versions check that the serialized and deserialized `ChartRenderingInfo` objects are equal.
2. **Owner Equality Check**: Both versions check that the deserialized `ChartRenderingInfo` object is the owner of its `PlotInfo`.

The refactoring improves readability and maintainability without changing the underlying functionality.
