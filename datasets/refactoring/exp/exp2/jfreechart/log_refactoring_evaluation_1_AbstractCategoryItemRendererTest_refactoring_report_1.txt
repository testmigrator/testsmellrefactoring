asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is **not** consistent. Hereâ€™s why:

### Original Test
- The original test creates two `BarRenderer` instances (`r1` and `r2`), sets the same series item label generator for the first series, and then checks that they are equal.
- It then sets a different series item label generator for the second series in `r2` and checks that `r1` and `r2` are not equal.

### Refactored Tests
- **`testEquals_ObjectList_SameGenerators`**: This test creates two `BarRenderer` instances (`r1` and `r2`), sets the same series item label generator for the first series, and checks that they are equal. This part is consistent with the original test.
- **`testEquals_ObjectList_DifferentGenerators`**: This test also creates two `BarRenderer` instances (`r1` and `r2`), sets the same series item label generator for the first series, but then sets a different series item label generator for the second series in `r2` and checks that `r1` and `r2` are not equal. However, this test reinitializes `r1` and `r2` within the method, which means the setup done in `setupTestEquals_ObjectList()` is effectively ignored. This leads to a different state of `r1` and `r2` compared to the original test.

### Inconsistency Overview
- **`testEquals_ObjectList_DifferentGenerators`**: The refactored test reinitializes `r1` and `r2` inside the method, which means the initial setup done in `setupTestEquals_ObjectList()` is not used. This results in a different state for `r1` and `r2` compared to the original test, where `r1` and `r2` are set up once and then modified.

To make the refactored tests consistent with the original test, the `setupTestEquals_ObjectList()` method should be removed or the initialization of `r1` and `r2` should be moved to the setup method and reused in both tests.
