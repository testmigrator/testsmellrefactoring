asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original and refactored tests is consistent. The refactored test uses `assertDoesNotThrow` from the JUnit 5 assertions to verify that no `NullPointerException` is thrown, which is equivalent to the original test's use of `fail` within a `try-catch` block to ensure no exception occurs. Both approaches aim to confirm that the code executes without throwing an unexpected exception.
