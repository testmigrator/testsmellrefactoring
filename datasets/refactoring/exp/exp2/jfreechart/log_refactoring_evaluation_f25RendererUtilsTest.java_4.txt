asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes primarily involve breaking down the single large test method into smaller, more focused test methods, each testing a specific scenario. This approach improves readability and maintainability without altering the underlying behavior or the expected outcomes of the tests. Each test case in the refactored version corresponds to a part of the original test, and the assertions and expected results remain consistent.
