asserts result: 
 The refactored tests are not consistent with the original test. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the reasons for the inconsistency:

1. **Redundant Initialization**:
   - In both `testEquals_ObjectList3_SameGenerators` and `testEquals_ObjectList3_DifferentGenerators`, the `BarRenderer` instances `r1` and `r2` are re-initialized within the test methods, even though they are already initialized in `setupTestEquals_ObjectList3`. This results in `r1` and `r2` being re-created, which means the setup done in `setupTestEquals_ObjectList3` is effectively ignored.

2. **Incorrect Setup**:
   - The `setupTestEquals_ObjectList3` method initializes `r1` and `r2` with a URL generator for series 0. However, in `testEquals_ObjectList3_DifferentGenerators`, the test re-creates `r1` and `r2` and then sets a URL generator for series 1 on `r2`. This does not match the original test, where only one instance (`r2`) had an additional URL generator set for series 1.

To make the refactored tests consistent with the original, the setup should be used correctly, and the redundant initialization should be removed. Here is the corrected version:

```java
private BarRenderer r1;
private BarRenderer r2;

private void setupTestEquals_ObjectList3() {
    r1 = new BarRenderer();
    r1.setSeriesItemURLGenerator(0, new StandardCategoryURLGenerator());
    r2 = new BarRenderer();
    r2.setSeriesItemURLGenerator(0, new StandardCategoryURLGenerator());
}

@Test
public void testEquals_ObjectList3_SameGenerators() {
    setupTestEquals_ObjectList3();
    assertEquals(r1, r2);
}

@Test
public void testEquals_ObjectList3_DifferentGenerators() {
    setupTestEquals_ObjectList3();
    r2.setSeriesItemURLGenerator(1, new StandardCategoryURLGenerator());
    assertNotEquals(r1, r2);
}
```

In this corrected version:
- The `BarRenderer` instances `r1` and `r2` are declared as instance variables.
- The `setupTestEquals_ObjectList3` method initializes these instances.
- The test methods use the initialized instances without re-creating them, ensuring the setup is applied correctly.
