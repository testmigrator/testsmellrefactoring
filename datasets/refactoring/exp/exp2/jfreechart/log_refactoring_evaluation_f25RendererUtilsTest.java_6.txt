asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each aspect of the original test (lower bound, upper bound, and bounds array) has been split into separate test methods, but the logic and assertions remain consistent. The creation of the `XYSeries` and `XYSeriesCollection` has been abstracted into helper methods (`createSeries` and `createDataset`), which do not alter the behavior of the tests. Therefore, the functionality is consistent between the original and refactored tests.
