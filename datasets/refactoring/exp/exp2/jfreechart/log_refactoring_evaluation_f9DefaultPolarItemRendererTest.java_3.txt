asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests cover all the assertions present in the original test method, and each assertion is now placed in its own test method for better clarity and separation of concerns. The functionality remains consistent, as each aspect of the cloning process (instances being different, classes being the same, initial state equality, and state change effects) is thoroughly checked. The use of `assertDoesNotThrow` ensures that the cloning operation does not throw an exception, which aligns with the original assumption that `CloneUtils.clone` will succeed.
