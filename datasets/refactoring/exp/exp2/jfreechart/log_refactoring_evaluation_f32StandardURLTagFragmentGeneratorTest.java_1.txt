asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each test case from the original `testGenerateURLFragment` method has been split into its own method (`testGenerateURLFragment_SimplePath`, `testGenerateURLFragment_RelativePath`, `testGenerateURLFragment_AbsolutePath`), and each still uses the `StandardURLTagFragmentGenerator` to generate URL fragments and compares the results using `assertEquals`. The only difference is the addition of more descriptive method names and error messages, which do not affect the functional consistency of the tests.
