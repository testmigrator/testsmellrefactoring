asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is not consistent. Here's an overview of the inconsistencies:

1. **Redundant Object Creation**: In the refactored tests, `GanttRenderer r1` and its properties (`setCompletePaint` and `setIncompletePaint`) are being set up twice: once in `setupTestSerialization()` and again within each test method (`testSerialization_Equality` and `testSerialization_Independence`). This redundancy can lead to potential issues if the setup logic changes, as it needs to be updated in multiple places.

2. **Inconsistent State**: The `setupTestSerialization()` method creates and serializes `r1` and `r2`, but the test methods then create new instances of `GanttRenderer` and re-serialize them. This means that the `r1` and `r2` used in the assertions are not the same objects that were set up in `setupTestSerialization()`, which can lead to incorrect test results.

To make the refactored tests consistent with the original, the `setupTestSerialization()` method should return the serialized objects or store them in instance variables, and the test methods should use these objects for their assertions. Hereâ€™s a revised version:

```java
private GanttRenderer r1;
private GanttRenderer r2;

private void setupTestSerialization() {
    r1 = new GanttRenderer();
    r1.setCompletePaint(new GradientPaint(1.0f, 2.0f, Color.RED, 3.0f, 4.0f, Color.BLUE));
    r1.setIncompletePaint(new GradientPaint(4.0f, 3.0f, Color.RED, 2.0f, 1.0f, Color.BLUE));
    r2 = TestUtils.serialised(r1);
}

@Test
public void testSerialization_Equality() {
    setupTestSerialization();
    assertEquals(r1, r2);
}

@Test
public void testSerialization_Independence() {
    setupTestSerialization();
    TestUtils.checkIndependence(r1, r2);
}
```

This ensures that the same `r1` and `r2` objects are used in both test methods, maintaining the consistency of the original test.
