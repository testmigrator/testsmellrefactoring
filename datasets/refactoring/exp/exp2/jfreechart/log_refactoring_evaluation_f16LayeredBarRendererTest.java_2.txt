asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version splits the original test into two separate tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `LayeredBarRenderer` class:

1. **testHashcode_Equality**: This test checks if two `LayeredBarRenderer` instances are equal.
2. **testHashcode_HashCodeEquality**: This test checks if the hash codes of two equal `LayeredBarRenderer` instances are also equal.

Both aspects were covered in the original test, so the refactored tests maintain the same functionality. Therefore, the answer is:

**yes**
