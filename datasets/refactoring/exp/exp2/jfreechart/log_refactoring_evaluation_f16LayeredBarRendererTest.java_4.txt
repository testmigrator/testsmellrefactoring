asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent.

- The original test `testSerialization` performs two checks:
  1. It asserts that the serialized and deserialized objects are equal using `assertEquals(r1, r2)`.
  2. It checks the independence of the serialized and deserialized objects using `TestUtils.checkIndependence(r1, r2)`.

- In the refactored version, these two checks have been split into two separate test methods:
  - `testSerialization_Equality` performs the equality check.
  - `testSerialization_Independence` performs the independence check.

Both the original and refactored versions perform the same operations and checks, so the functionality remains consistent. Therefore, the answer is:

**yes**
