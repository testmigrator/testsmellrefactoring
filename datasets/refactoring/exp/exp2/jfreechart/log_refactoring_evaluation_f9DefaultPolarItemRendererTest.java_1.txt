The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks the equality of two `DefaultPolarItemRenderer` objects in their default state and after modifying the `seriesFilled` property. The refactored tests achieve the same objectives:

1. **testEquals_DefaultState**: This test verifies that two default `DefaultPolarItemRenderer` objects are equal, which corresponds to the first part of the original test.
2. **testEquals_SeriesFilledChanged**: This test checks that the renderers are not equal after one of them has its `seriesFilled` property changed, and then verifies that they become equal again when both have the same `seriesFilled` property set.

The refactoring improves readability and modularity by separating the concerns into two distinct tests, but it does not change the overall functionality being tested.
