asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks two conditions:
1. The legend item is not null when the series is visible in the legend.
2. The legend item is null when the series is hidden in the legend.

These conditions are preserved in the refactored tests:
- `testGetLegendItem_LegendItemNotNull` ensures that the legend item is not null when the series is visible.
- `testGetLegendItem_LegendItemNullWhenHidden` ensures that the legend item is null when the series is hidden.

The refactoring splits the original test into two separate tests, each focusing on one specific condition, which improves clarity and maintainability. The setup methods (`setupDataset` and `setupRendererWithPlot`) are used to reduce code duplication and make the tests more modular.
