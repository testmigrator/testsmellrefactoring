asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test `testConstructor2` checks the lower bound, upper bound, and default paint of a `LookupPaintScale` object. The refactored tests split these checks into three separate methods (`testConstructor_LowerBound`, `testConstructor_UpperBound`, and `testConstructor_DefaultPaint`), but each of these methods still performs the same assertions as the original test. Additionally, the use of constants and a helper method (`createLookupPaintScale`) does not change the behavior or the outcome of the tests. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
