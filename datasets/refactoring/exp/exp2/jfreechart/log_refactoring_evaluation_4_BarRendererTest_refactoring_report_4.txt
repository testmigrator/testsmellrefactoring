asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The only difference is that the setup code has been moved to a separate method `setupTestEventNotification`, but this method is not called in the refactored test. Instead, the setup code is still included directly within the `testEventNotification_SetDefaultPaint` method, ensuring that the behavior and the test conditions remain identical to the original test. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
