asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test code maintains the same functionality as the original test code. The changes made are primarily for readability and clarity, such as renaming the tolerance variable to `tolerance` and explicitly defining `expectedNumber`. These changes do not alter the behavior or the assertions of the test.
