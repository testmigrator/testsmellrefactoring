asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original and refactored tests is consistent. The refactoring primarily involves moving the expected values and tolerances into variables, which does not change the behavior or outcome of the test. The assertions remain the same, ensuring that the parameters of the Gaussian curve fit match the expected values within the specified tolerances.
