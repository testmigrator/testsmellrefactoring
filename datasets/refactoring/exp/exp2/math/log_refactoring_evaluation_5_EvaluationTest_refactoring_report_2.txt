asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily for readability and to reduce redundancy, such as defining `expectedResiduals`, `expectedJacobian`, and `epsilon` at the beginning of the test method. The assertions and the overall structure of the test remain consistent, ensuring that the same conditions are checked and verified.
