asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. Both tests aim to verify that a `ConvergenceException` is thrown when attempting to optimize a non-invertible linear problem. The original test uses a try-catch block to catch the exception and ensure the test passes if the exception is thrown. The refactored test uses the `assertThrows` method to achieve the same goal, which is a more modern and concise way to test for exceptions in JUnit. Both approaches will pass the test if a `ConvergenceException` is thrown and fail otherwise.
