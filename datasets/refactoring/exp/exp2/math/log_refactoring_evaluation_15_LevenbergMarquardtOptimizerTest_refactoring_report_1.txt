asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. Both tests aim to verify that a `SingularMatrixException` is thrown when attempting to compute covariances on a non-invertible matrix. The main changes in the refactored code include:

1. **Exception Handling**: The original test uses a try-catch block to catch the `SingularMatrixException`, while the refactored test uses `assertThrows` to assert that the exception is thrown. This change is functionally equivalent and is a more modern and concise way to handle exceptions in JUnit tests.

2. **Assertion on RMS Value**: The condition to check if the RMS value indicates a bad fit is preserved in both versions. The refactored test includes a more descriptive message for the assertion, which improves readability but does not change the functional behavior.

3. **Removal of `fail(optimizer)`**: The `fail(optimizer)` call in the original test is removed in the refactored version. This is appropriate because the `assertThrows` method will fail the test if the expected exception is not thrown, making the explicit `fail` call redundant.

Overall, the refactored test is functionally consistent with the original test.
