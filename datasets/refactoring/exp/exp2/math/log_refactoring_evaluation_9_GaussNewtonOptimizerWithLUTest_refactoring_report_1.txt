asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. Both versions of the test are designed to ensure that a `ConvergenceException` is thrown when `super.testMoreEstimatedParametersSimple()` is executed. The original test uses a try-catch block to catch the exception and verify its occurrence, while the refactored test uses the `assertThrows` method to achieve the same purpose. Both approaches are functionally equivalent in this context.
