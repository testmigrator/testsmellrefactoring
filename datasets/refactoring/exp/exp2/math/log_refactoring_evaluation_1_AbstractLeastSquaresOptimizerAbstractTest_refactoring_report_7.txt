asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The only changes are:
1. The addition of a `tolerance` variable to make the tolerance value more explicit.
2. The use of a named variable `expectedNumber` for the expected RMS value (which is 0).

These changes do not alter the behavior or the outcome of the test. The assertion still checks that the RMS value is equal to 0 within a specified tolerance.
