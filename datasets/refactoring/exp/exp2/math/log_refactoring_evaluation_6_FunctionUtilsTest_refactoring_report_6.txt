asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactoring splits the original single test method into two separate methods, each testing a specific combination of functions (`Add` and `Multiply`). The logic and assertions within each refactored test method are equivalent to the corresponding parts in the original test method. The introduction of `expectedResult` and the `setupTestCombine` method does not alter the behavior or the expected outcomes of the tests.
