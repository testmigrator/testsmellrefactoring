asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily in variable naming and the explicit declaration of `expectedIntegralValue` and `epsilon`, which do not alter the behavior or the outcome of the test. The integration process and the assertion remain consistent between the two versions.
