asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The changes made in the refactored version primarily involve the introduction of variables `expectedIterations` and `expectedEvaluations` to store the expected values, and using these variables in the assertions. This does not alter the behavior or the outcome of the test; it merely enhances readability and maintainability. The assertions still check that the `optimum` object has the correct number of iterations and evaluations, which is the same as in the original test.
