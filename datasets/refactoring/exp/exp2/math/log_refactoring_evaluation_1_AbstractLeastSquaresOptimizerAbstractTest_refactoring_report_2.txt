asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily to improve readability and maintainability by defining constants for expected values and tolerances. The assertions in both versions of the test check the same conditions:

1. `optimum.getRMS()` is compared to `0` with a tolerance.
2. `optimum.getPoint()` is checked against the expected dimensions and value.
3. `optimum.getResiduals()` is verified against the expected residuals.

These checks are consistent in both the original and refactored tests, ensuring that the functionality remains the same.
