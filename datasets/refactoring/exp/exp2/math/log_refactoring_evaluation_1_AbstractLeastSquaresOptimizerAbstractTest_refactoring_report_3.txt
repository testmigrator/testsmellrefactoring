asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original and refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version introduces helper methods `assertRMS` and `assertOptimumPoints` to encapsulate the assertions, and a condition `isProblemValid` to control whether the test runs. However, the core logic and the expected outcomes remain the same, ensuring that the test still verifies the same conditions as the original test.
