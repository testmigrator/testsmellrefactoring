asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test combined two functionalities into one method: testing the `scaler` function and testing the equivalence of `pow1` and `pow2`. The refactored version separates these into two distinct methods, `testFixingArguments_Scaler` and `testFixingArguments_Power`, but each retains the same logic and assertions as the original. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
