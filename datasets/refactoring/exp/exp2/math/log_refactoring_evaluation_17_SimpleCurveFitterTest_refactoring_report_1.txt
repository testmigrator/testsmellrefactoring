asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily structural, breaking down the original single method into smaller, more focused methods (`generateDataPoints` and `fitPolynomial`). These changes do not alter the logic or the outcome of the test. The seeds for the random number generators and the tolerance for the assertion are also preserved, ensuring that the behavior remains consistent.
