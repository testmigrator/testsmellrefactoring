asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original and refactored tests is consistent. The changes made in the refactoring do not alter the behavior or the purpose of the test. The refactoring includes:

1. **Variable Extraction**: `tolerance`, `expectedRMS`, and `expectedPoint` are extracted into variables for better readability.
2. **Assertion Updates**: The assertions are updated to use the extracted variables.
3. **Exception Handling**: The exception handling is changed from a try-catch block to using `assertThrows` for better clarity and conciseness.

These changes improve the readability and maintainability of the test without changing its functional behavior.

**Response:**
yes
