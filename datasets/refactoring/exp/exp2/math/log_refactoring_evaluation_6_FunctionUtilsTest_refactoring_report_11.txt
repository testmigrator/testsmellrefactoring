asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The primary changes involve breaking down the original test into smaller, more modular methods and constants, but the core logic and assertions remain consistent. Each of the new test methods (`testDerivativeUnivariate_f0`, `testDerivativeUnivariate_f1`, `testDerivativeUnivariate_f2`) performs the same checks as the original `testDerivativeUnivariate` method, ensuring that the derivatives are calculated correctly over the specified range.
