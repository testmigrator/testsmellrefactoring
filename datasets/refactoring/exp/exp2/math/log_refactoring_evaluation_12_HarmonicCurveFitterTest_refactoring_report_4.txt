asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes primarily involve breaking down the original `testUnsorted` method into smaller, more focused methods (`createHarmonicOscillator`, `generateShuffledData`, `assertFittedValues`, and `performFit`). These methods encapsulate specific parts of the original logic, but when combined, they perform the same operations and assertions as the original test.

- The `createHarmonicOscillator` method initializes the `HarmonicOscillator` object with the same parameters.
- The `generateShuffledData` method generates and shuffles the data, then prepares it for fitting.
- The `assertFittedValues` method performs the same assertions on the fitted values.
- The `performFit` method orchestrates the fitting process using the `HarmonicCurveFitter`.

Both the original and refactored tests use the same seed for the random number generator, ensuring that the randomness is consistent across runs. The assertions and the fitting process are also identical in both versions. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
