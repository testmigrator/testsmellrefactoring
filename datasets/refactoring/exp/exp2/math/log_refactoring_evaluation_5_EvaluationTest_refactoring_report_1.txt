asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The setup and action parts are identical, and the singularity failure check has been updated to use `assertThrows`, which is a more modern and concise way to assert that an exception is thrown. This change does not affect the functionality of the test.
