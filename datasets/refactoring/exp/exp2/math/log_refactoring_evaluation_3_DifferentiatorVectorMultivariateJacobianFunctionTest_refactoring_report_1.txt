asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The main changes involve extracting the parameter and covariance matrix checks into a separate method named `checkout`. This method performs the same assertions on the solutions and covariance matrices, ensuring that the behavior of the test remains consistent. The checks for goodness-of-fit measures are still performed in the main test method, using the same tolerances and methods as before. Therefore, the refactoring does not alter the functionality of the test.
