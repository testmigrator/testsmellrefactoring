asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The refactoring splits the original single test into two separate tests (`testParameterValidator_Optimization` and `testParameterValidator_CheatOptimization`) and introduces a common setup method (`setupTestParameterValidator`). This setup method initializes the necessary variables and objects used in both tests, ensuring that the setup is consistent across the tests.

Both refactored tests perform the same steps as the original test:
1. They set up the initial conditions and parameters using the `setupTestParameterValidator` method.
2. They run the optimization process and check the number of evaluations.
3. The second test additionally sets up a cheating validator and runs another optimization process to ensure that the number of evaluations is reduced.

The assertions and logic in the refactored tests are equivalent to those in the original test, maintaining the consistency in functionality.
