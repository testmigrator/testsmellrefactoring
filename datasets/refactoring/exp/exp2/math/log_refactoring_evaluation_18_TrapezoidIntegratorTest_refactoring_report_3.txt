asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each of the original test cases has been split into separate methods, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `TrapezoidIntegrator` class. The assertions and exceptions being checked are consistent with the original test, ensuring that the same conditions and exceptions are tested.
