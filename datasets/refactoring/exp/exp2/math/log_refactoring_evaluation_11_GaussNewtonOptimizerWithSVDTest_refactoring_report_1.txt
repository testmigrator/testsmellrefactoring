asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test code is functionally equivalent to the original test code. Both tests are designed to check if a `TooManyEvaluationsException` is thrown when the optimizer exceeds the maximum number of evaluations. The only difference is in the way the exception handling is implemented:

- The original code uses a try-catch block and calls `fail(optimizer)` if no exception is thrown.
- The refactored code uses the `assertThrows` method from JUnit 5, which is a more modern and concise way to assert that an exception is thrown.

Both approaches ensure that the test fails if the expected `TooManyEvaluationsException` is not thrown, maintaining the same functionality.
