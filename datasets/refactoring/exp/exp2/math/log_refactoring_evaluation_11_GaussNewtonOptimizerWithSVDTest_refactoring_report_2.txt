asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. Both tests aim to ensure that an `AssertionError` is thrown when `super.testCircleFittingBadInit()` is called. The original test uses a try-catch block to catch the `AssertionError` and then checks if it was indeed thrown. The refactored test uses the `assertThrows` method from JUnit 5 to achieve the same result, ensuring that an `AssertionError` is thrown. Therefore, the behavior and intent of the tests remain the same.
