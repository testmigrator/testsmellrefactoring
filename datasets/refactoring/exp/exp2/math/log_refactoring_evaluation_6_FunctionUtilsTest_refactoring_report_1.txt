The refactored tests are not entirely consistent with the original tests:

1. **Inconsistent Handling of Input Values**:
   - The original test uses different input values for different test cases, specifically `3` for most cases and `2` and `9876.54321` for specific cases. However, the refactored test uses a fixed input value `INPUT_VALUE_3` for all cases in `testComposeDifferentiable`, which can lead to incorrect results for test cases that require different input values.

2. **Incorrect Expected Values in Parameterized Tests**:
   - In the `testComposeDifferentiable` method, the expected values are derived from the string representation of the last function in the array, which is not a reliable way to determine the expected output. For example, `"INV, M, ID, 0.25"` assumes that the expected value is `0.25`, but this is not necessarily correct based on the composition of functions.
   - The `testComposeLogPower` method correctly uses the expected values provided in the CSV source, but the original test calculates the expected value dynamically, which might be more accurate.

3. **Missing Test Cases**:
   - The original test includes a case where the input value is `2` for the `Inverse` function, but the refactored test only uses `INPUT_VALUE_3` for all cases in `testComposeDifferentiable`.
   - The original test also includes a specific test for the `log` and `pow` composition with the input value `9876.54321`, but the refactored test uses a different approach to verify the result, which might not be equivalent.

To ensure consistency, the refactored tests should:
- Use the correct input values for each test case.
- Calculate expected values dynamically or ensure that the provided expected values are accurate.
- Include all the original test cases to cover the same scenarios.
