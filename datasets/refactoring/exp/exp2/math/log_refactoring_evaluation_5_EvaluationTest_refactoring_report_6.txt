asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. Both tests:

1. Set up a `StatisticalReferenceDataset` and a `LeastSquaresProblem`.
2. Create a `RealVector` point.
3. Evaluate the problem using the point.
4. Assert that the point passed to the `evaluate` method and the point returned by the `evaluation` are not the same instance.
5. Modify the first entry of the original point.
6. Assert that the first entry of the evaluation point remains unchanged.

The only difference is the use of `assertDoesNotThrow` in the refactored test to ensure no exceptions are thrown during setup and action phases, which does not affect the core functionality being tested.
