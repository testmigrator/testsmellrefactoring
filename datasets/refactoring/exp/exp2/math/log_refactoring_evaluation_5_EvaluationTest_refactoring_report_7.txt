asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily to modernize the test assertions using `assertThrows` and `assertDoesNotThrow`, which are more concise and expressive ways to handle expected exceptions in JUnit tests. The logic and conditions being tested remain consistent:

1. The first part of the test still expects a `MathIllegalStateException` when `LeastSquaresFactory.create` is called with an instance of `MultivariateJacobianFunction` that does not implement `ValueAndJacobianFunction`.
2. The second part of the test still ensures that no exception is thrown when `LeastSquaresFactory.create` is called with an instance of `ValueAndJacobianFunction`.

These changes do not alter the behavior or the outcome of the tests.
