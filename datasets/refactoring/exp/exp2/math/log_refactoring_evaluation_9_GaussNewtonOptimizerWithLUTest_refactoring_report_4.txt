asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. Both tests expect a `ConvergenceException` to be thrown when calling `super.testCircleFittingBadInit()`. The original test uses a try-catch block to catch the exception and verify that it was thrown, while the refactored test uses the `assertThrows` method to achieve the same result. The functionality is consistent.
