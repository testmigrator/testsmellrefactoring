asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test code maintains the same functionality as the original test. Both versions expect a `ConvergenceException` to be thrown when `super.testCircleFittingBadInit()` is called. The original test uses a try-catch block to catch the exception and verify that it was thrown, while the refactored version uses the `assertThrows` method to achieve the same result in a more concise manner. The behavior and intent of the test remain consistent.
