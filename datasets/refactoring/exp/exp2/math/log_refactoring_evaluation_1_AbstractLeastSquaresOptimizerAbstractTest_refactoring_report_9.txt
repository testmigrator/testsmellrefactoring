asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The changes made in the refactored version do not alter the behavior of the test. They primarily involve:

1. Introducing named variables (`tolerance`, `initialX`, `initialY`, `expectedNumber`) for better readability.
2. Using these named variables in place of hard-coded values.

These changes improve the readability and maintainability of the code without changing its functional behavior.

**Response:**
yes
