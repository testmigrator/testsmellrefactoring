asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks both the equality and the hash code of two `JsonPrimitive` objects, and the refactored version splits these checks into two separate test methods but still performs the same assertions. The use of a setup method (`setupTestByteEqualsInteger`) ensures that the state is correctly initialized for each test, maintaining the consistency of the test logic.
