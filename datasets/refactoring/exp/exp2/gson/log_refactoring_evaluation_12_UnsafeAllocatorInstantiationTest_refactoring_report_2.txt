asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The primary changes are:

1. Adding a descriptive message to the `assertThrows` method, which helps in understanding what the assertion is expecting if it fails.
2. Using `withFailMessage` in the `assertThat` method to provide a more detailed failure message if the assertion fails.

These changes do not alter the behavior or the outcome of the test; they only enhance the readability and diagnostics of the test. Therefore, the functionality remains consistent.
