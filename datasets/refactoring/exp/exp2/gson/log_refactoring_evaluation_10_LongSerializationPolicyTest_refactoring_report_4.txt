asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The primary changes involve wrapping the assertions in an `assertDoesNotThrow` method to ensure that no exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test, and adding descriptive messages to each assertion. These changes do not alter the core behavior or the expected outcomes of the test.
