asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version splits the original single test into two separate tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `deepCopy` method:

1. **testDeepCopy_OriginalContainsAddedElement**: This test verifies that the original JSON object contains the added element after the deep copy is made.
2. **testDeepCopy_CopyDoesNotContainAddedElement**: This test verifies that the copied JSON object does not contain the added element.

Both aspects were implicitly tested in the original test, but the refactored version makes the tests more explicit and easier to understand. The assertions in the refactored tests are equivalent to those in the original test, ensuring that the behavior remains the same.
