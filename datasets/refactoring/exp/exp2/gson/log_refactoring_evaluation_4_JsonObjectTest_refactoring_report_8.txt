asserts result: 
 No, the functionality is not consistent.

**Inconsistency Overview:**
- **Original Test:** The original test uses `MoreAsserts.assertEqualsAndHashCode` to assert both equality and hash code consistency between two empty `JsonObject` instances.
- **Refactored Test:** In the refactored version, the assertion has been commented out, effectively removing the test. This means that the test no longer checks for equality or hash code consistency, which changes the behavior and purpose of the test.

Therefore, the refactored test does not perform the same functionality as the original test.
