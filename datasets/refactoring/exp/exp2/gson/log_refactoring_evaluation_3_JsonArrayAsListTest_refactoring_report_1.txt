asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily stylistic and do not alter the behavior or the assertions being made. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Variable Introduction**: A variable `firstElementValue` is introduced to hold the value `1`. This does not change the functionality; it just makes the code more readable.

2. **Enhanced Assertions**: The `assertThat` method calls now include `withFailMessage` to provide more detailed error messages if the assertions fail. This improves the readability and maintainability of the tests without changing their behavior.

3. **AssertThrows Messages**: The `assertThrows` method calls now include custom messages to clarify what each assertion is testing. Again, this is an improvement in readability and does not affect the functionality.

All the assertions and exception checks remain the same, ensuring that the refactored test is functionally equivalent to the original test.
