asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests cover all the steps and assertions present in the original test method `testSkipDouble`. Each step in the original test has been broken down into separate test methods, ensuring that each part of the functionality is tested individually. The overall functionality remains consistent, as each test in the refactored version checks the same conditions and expectations as the original test.
