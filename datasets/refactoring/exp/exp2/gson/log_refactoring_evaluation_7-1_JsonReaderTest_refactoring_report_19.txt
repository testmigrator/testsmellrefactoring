asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is **not** consistent. Here's a breakdown of the inconsistencies:

1. **`testSkipObject_SkipFirstValue`**:
   - Inconsistency: This test only checks the first key and skips the value, then immediately ends the object without checking the second key or verifying the end document token. This is different from the original test, which also checks the second key and verifies the end document token.

2. **`testSkipObject_SkipSecondValue`**:
   - Inconsistency: This test checks both keys and skips their values but does not verify the end document token. The original test includes this verification.

3. **`testSkipObject_EndDocument`**:
   - Inconsistency: This test checks both keys, skips their values, and verifies the end document token. However, it is redundant with `testSkipObject_NoExceptionThrown`, which does the same thing but also asserts that no exceptions are thrown.

4. **`testSkipObject_NoExceptionThrown`**:
   - Inconsistency: This test is essentially a combination of the other tests but adds an assertion that no exceptions are thrown. While this is a good practice, it does not change the fact that the other tests are incomplete compared to the original test.

To make the refactored tests consistent with the original test, you should combine the necessary checks into a single test or ensure that each test covers all the steps and verifications present in the original test. Specifically, each test should:
- Begin the object.
- Check the first key.
- Skip the first value.
- Check the second key.
- Skip the second value.
- End the object.
- Verify the end document token.

Here is a revised version of the refactored test that is consistent with the original:

```java
@Test
public void testSkipObject() {
    assertDoesNotThrow(() -> {
        JsonReader reader = createJsonReader("{\"a\": { \"c\": [], \"d\": [true, true, {}] }, \"b\": \"banana\"}");
        reader.beginObject();
        assertEquals("a", reader.nextName(), "Expected first key to be 'a'");
        reader.skipValue();
        assertEquals("b", reader.nextName(), "Expected second key to be 'b'");
        reader.skipValue();
        reader.endObject();
        assertEquals(JsonToken.END_DOCUMENT, reader.peek(), "Expected the next token to be END_DOCUMENT");
    }, "No exception should be thrown during the test");
}
```

This single test now covers all the steps and verifications present in the original test.
