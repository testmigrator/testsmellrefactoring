asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The key points that ensure consistency are:

1. **Creation of Custom Gson**: The `createCustomGson()` method in the refactored code replicates the initial setup of the `Gson` object, ensuring that the original configuration is preserved.

2. **Modification of GsonBuilder**: The `modifyGsonBuilder(GsonBuilder gsonBuilder)` method encapsulates the modifications made to the `GsonBuilder`, which are then applied to a new `Gson` instance created from the modified builder. This ensures that the modifications do not affect the original `Gson` object or any new `Gson` objects created from the original builder.

3. **Test Assertions**:
   - The first test (`testNewBuilderModification_CustomGsonUnaffected`) checks that the original `Gson` object and any new `Gson` objects created from the original builder remain unaffected by the modifications.
   - The second test (`testNewBuilderModification_ModifiedGsonAffected`) verifies that the `Gson` object created from the modified builder reflects the changes made.

Both tests in the refactored code cover the same scenarios as the original test, ensuring that the functionality is consistent.
