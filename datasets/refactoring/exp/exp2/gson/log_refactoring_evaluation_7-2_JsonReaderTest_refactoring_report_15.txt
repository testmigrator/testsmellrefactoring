asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The changes made do not alter the behavior or the outcome of the test. Both tests aim to verify that calling `nextNull()` on a `JsonReader` when the next token is a string results in an `IllegalStateException`, and both check that the error message matches the expected structure.

Therefore, the response is: **yes**.
