asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored tests have been split into three separate methods, each focusing on a specific aspect of the original test, but they all maintain the same assertions and logic. The use of `assertDoesNotThrow` in the refactored tests ensures that no unexpected exceptions are thrown, which aligns with the implicit expectation in the original test. The expected values and the structure of the JSON being parsed remain the same in both versions.
