The refactored tests cover all the cases present in the original `testLongs` method, and each specific scenario (zero values, positive values, negative values, minimum long value, and maximum long value) is tested individually. The functionality remains consistent across both versions. Each test method in the refactored version checks the same conditions as the original test but in a more modular and readable way.
