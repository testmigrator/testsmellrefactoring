asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each aspect that was originally checked in the single `testOverridesDefaultExcluder` method is now verified in separate test methods. The `createGsonWithCustomExcluder` method is used to create a `Gson` instance with the same configuration as in the original test, ensuring that the behavior remains consistent. The assertions in the refactored tests are also equivalent to those in the original test, verifying the same properties of the `Gson` object.
