asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. Both the original and refactored tests ensure that:

1. The JSON reader correctly identifies that there are no tokens after starting an object (`reader.hasNext()` returns `false`).
2. The JSON reader correctly ends the object without issues.
3. The JSON reader correctly identifies that the next token is `END_DOCUMENT`.

The refactored version splits the original test into two separate tests to better isolate the checks and improve readability and maintainability. However, the overall behavior and assertions remain the same.

**Answer:**
yes
