asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks both equality and hash code equivalence in a single method, while the refactored version splits these into two separate methods (`testByteEqualsBigInteger_Equality` and `testByteEqualsBigInteger_HashCode`). However, the logic and assertions remain the same, ensuring that the functionality is consistent. The use of a setup method (`setupTestByteEqualsBigInteger`) ensures that the same initial conditions are used for both tests, preserving the original test's intent.
