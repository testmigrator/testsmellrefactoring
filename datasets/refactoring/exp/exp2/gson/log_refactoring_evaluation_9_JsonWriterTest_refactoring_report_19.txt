asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original and refactored test is consistent. The refactored test adds an `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure that no unexpected exceptions occur during the execution of the JSON writing process, but this does not change the expected outcome of the test. The assertion at the end still checks that the `stringWriter` contains the expected JSON string, which is the same as in the original test.
