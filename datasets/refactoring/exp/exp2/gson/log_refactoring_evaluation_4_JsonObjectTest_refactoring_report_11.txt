The refactored tests cover the same scenarios as the original test, ensuring that the functionality remains consistent. Each refactored test method focuses on a specific aspect of the `size` method behavior, which collectively covers all the checks performed in the original single test method. The assertions and their expected outcomes are equivalent, maintaining the integrity of the test coverage.
