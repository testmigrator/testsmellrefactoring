asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks both equality and hash code equivalence in one method, while the refactored version splits these checks into two separate methods (`testShortEqualsBigInteger_Equality` and `testShortEqualsBigInteger_HashCode`). However, both the original and refactored versions perform the same assertions, ensuring that `p1` and `p2` are equal and that their hash codes are equal. The use of a setup method (`setupTestShortEqualsBigInteger`) ensures that the same initial conditions are used for both tests, maintaining consistency with the original test's behavior.
