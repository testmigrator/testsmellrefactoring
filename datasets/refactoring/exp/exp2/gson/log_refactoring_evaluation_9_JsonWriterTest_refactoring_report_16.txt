asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is not consistent. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the reasons for the inconsistency:

1. **Exception Handling**: 
   - **Original Test**: The original test directly uses `assertThrows` to check that an `IllegalStateException` is thrown when calling `jsonWriter.endObject()` after starting two arrays.
   - **Refactored Test**: The refactored test wraps the entire block in an `assertDoesNotThrow`, which is contradictory because it expects no exceptions to be thrown. This changes the behavior from expecting an exception to expecting no exception.

2. **Assertion Messages**:
   - **Original Test**: The original test does not provide a custom failure message for the assertion.
   - **Refactored Test**: The refactored test adds custom failure messages for both the `assertThrows` and `assertDoesNotThrow` methods, which can be useful but changes the structure and intent of the test.

3. **Test Naming**:
   - **Original Test**: The test name is `testBadNestingArray`.
   - **Refactored Test**: The test name is `testBadNestingArray_beginArrayEndObject`. While more descriptive, this change in naming could affect how the test is referenced or understood in a larger context.

Given these points, the refactored test does not maintain the same functionality as the original test. The primary issue is the use of `assertDoesNotThrow`, which contradicts the expected behavior of the original test. 

**Inconsistent Test**: `testBadNestingArray_beginArrayEndObject`

**Reason**: The refactored test expects no exceptions to be thrown, while the original test expects an `IllegalStateException` to be thrown.
