asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The refactored code introduces a helper method `setupTestStringWithLeadingSlash` to set up the `JsonReader` object, but the actual test logic remains the same. Both versions of the test check that calling `peek` on a `JsonReader` with a leading slash throws a `MalformedJsonException` with the expected error message.
