asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. Both tests:
- Create a JSON string with a truncated escape sequence.
- Use `JsonReader` to parse the JSON string.
- Begin an array using `reader.beginArray()`.
- Assert that a `MalformedJsonException` is thrown when calling `reader.nextString()`.
- Check that the exception message matches the expected message.

The only differences are:
- The refactored test uses a `StringReader` directly instead of a method `reader(json)`, but this does not affect the functionality.
- The refactored test includes a more detailed message in the `assertThrows` method, which provides additional context if the test fails, but does not change the core behavior of the test.
