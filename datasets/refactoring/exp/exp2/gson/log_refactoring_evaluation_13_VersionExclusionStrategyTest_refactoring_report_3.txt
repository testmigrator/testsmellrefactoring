asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original and refactored tests is consistent. The only change in the refactored version is the wrapping of the test logic inside an `assertDoesNotThrow` method call, which ensures that no unexpected exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test. This does not alter the behavior or the assertions being made within the test.
