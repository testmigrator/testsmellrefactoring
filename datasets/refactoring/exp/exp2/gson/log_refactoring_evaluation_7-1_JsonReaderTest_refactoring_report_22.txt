asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each of the refactored tests focuses on a specific part of the original test, ensuring that the `skipValue` method works correctly and that the subsequent calls to `peek`, `getPath`, and `nextInt` produce the expected results. The use of `assertDoesNotThrow` in the first refactored test ensures that no unexpected exceptions are thrown during the `skipValue` operation, which is consistent with the original test's implicit assumption that `skipValue` should not throw an exception.
