asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests cover the same functionality as the original test but break it down into smaller, more focused tests. Each refactored test checks a specific aspect of the `testMixedCaseLiterals` method, such as handling boolean values in different cases and null values. The final test `testMixedCaseLiterals_EndDocument` ensures that the entire array is processed correctly and ends with the expected token. The functionality remains consistent between the original and refactored tests.
