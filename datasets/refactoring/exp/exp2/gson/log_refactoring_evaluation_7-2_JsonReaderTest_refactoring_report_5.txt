asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks two things:

1. The `peek` method returns `NUMBER`.
2. The `nextLong` method throws a `NumberFormatException`.

In the refactored version, these checks are split into two separate tests:

1. `testLongLargerThanMaxLongThatWrapsAround_ReaderPeek` checks that `peek` returns `JsonToken.NUMBER` and provides a more detailed failure message.
2. `testLongLargerThanMaxLongThatWrapsAround_NextLongThrowsException` checks that `nextLong` throws a `NumberFormatException` and also provides a more detailed failure message.

Both refactored tests cover the same functionality as the original test, ensuring that the behavior remains consistent.
