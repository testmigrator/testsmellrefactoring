asserts result: 
 no

**Inconsistency Overview:**

1. **Original Test:**
   - The original test directly calls `jsonWriter.beginObject()` and `jsonWriter.name("a")`, then asserts that calling `jsonWriter.endObject()` throws an `IllegalStateException` with the message "Dangling name: a".

2. **Refactored Test:**
   - The refactored test wraps the entire sequence of operations inside an `assertDoesNotThrow` block. This means that if any part of the code inside the `assertDoesNotThrow` block throws an exception, the test will fail, even if the exception is expected.
   - Additionally, the refactored test includes a more detailed assertion message using `withFailMessage`, but this does not affect the consistency of the functionality.

**Reason for Inconsistency:**
- The use of `assertDoesNotThrow` in the refactored test changes the behavior. If any exception is thrown during the execution of the code inside the `assertDoesNotThrow` block (e.g., during `jsonWriter.beginObject()` or `jsonWriter.name("a")`), the test will fail, even though these operations should not throw exceptions under normal circumstances.
- The original test only checks for the specific `IllegalStateException` when calling `jsonWriter.endObject()`, while the refactored test could fail prematurely if any other part of the code throws an unexpected exception.
