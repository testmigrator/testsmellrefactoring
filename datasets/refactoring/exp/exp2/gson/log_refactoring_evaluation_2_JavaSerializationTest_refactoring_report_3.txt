asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original and refactored tests is consistent. The refactored test uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure that no exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test, which is a reasonable change to make the test more robust. Additionally, the refactored test includes descriptive messages in the assertions, which does not affect the functionality but improves the readability and maintainability of the test.
