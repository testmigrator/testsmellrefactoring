asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks that `nextInt()` throws a `NumberFormatException` and then verifies that `nextDouble()` reads the correct double value. The refactored version splits this into two separate tests but still performs the same checks:

1. `testIntegerMismatchFailuresDoNotAdvance_ExceptionThrown` ensures that `nextInt()` throws a `NumberFormatException`.
2. `testIntegerMismatchFailuresDoNotAdvance_ReadDouble` ensures that `nextDouble()` correctly reads the double value after the exception.

Both the original and refactored tests achieve the same purpose, so the functionality is consistent.
