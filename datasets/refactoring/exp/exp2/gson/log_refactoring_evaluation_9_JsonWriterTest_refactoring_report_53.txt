 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original single test has been broken down into three separate tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `testSetGetFormattingStyle` method:

1. **`testSetGetFormattingStyle_DefaultFormattingStyle`**: This test checks that the default formatting style is `FormattingStyle.COMPACT`, which is consistent with the original test.

2. **`testSetGetFormattingStyle_SetFormattingStyle`**: This test verifies that the newline character in the formatting style is correctly set to the provided line separator, which is also consistent with the original test.

3. **`testSetGetFormattingStyle_WriteFormattedJson`**: This test ensures that the JSON array is written correctly with the specified formatting style, and it matches the expected output, which is consistent with the original test.

Each of these tests covers a part of the original test, ensuring that all the functionality is preserved.
