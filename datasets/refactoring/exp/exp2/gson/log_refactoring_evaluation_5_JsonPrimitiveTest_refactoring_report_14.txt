asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks both equality and hash code equivalence in a single method, while the refactored version splits these checks into two separate methods (`testIntegerEqualsLong_Equality` and `testIntegerEqualsLong_HashCode`). Each of these methods calls a common setup method (`setupTestIntegerEqualsLong`) to initialize the `JsonPrimitive` objects, ensuring that the same initial conditions are used for both tests. This approach preserves the original test's intent and behavior.
