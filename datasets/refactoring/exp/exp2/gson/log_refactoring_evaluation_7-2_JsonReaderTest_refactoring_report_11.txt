asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. Both tests perform the same actions and assertions:

1. They create a `JsonReader` instance with a malformed JSON string `{"a":}`.
2. They begin reading an object.
3. They assert that the next name is `"a"`.
4. They expect a `MalformedJsonException` to be thrown when attempting to read the next string.
5. They assert that the exception message matches the expected message.

The only differences are in the way the assertions are written and the additional error messages provided in the refactored version, but these do not affect the overall functionality of the test.
