asserts result: 
 The refactored tests are consistent with the original test in terms of functionality. Each refactored test focuses on a specific part of the original test, ensuring that all aspects are still covered:

1. **`testReadEmptyArray_beginArray`**: Checks that `beginArray` does not throw an unexpected exception.
2. **`testReadEmptyArray_hasNext`**: Verifies that `hasNext` returns `false` after calling `beginArray`.
3. **`testReadEmptyArray_endArray`**: Ensures that `endArray` does not throw an unexpected exception.
4. **`testReadEmptyArray_peek`**: Confirms that `peek` returns `END_DOCUMENT` after calling `beginArray` and `endArray`.

Each of these tests collectively covers the same functionality as the original `testReadEmptyArray` method.

**Response:**
yes
