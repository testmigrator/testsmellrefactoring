asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each refactored test method focuses on a specific part of the original test:

1. `testLenientExtraCommasInMaps_BeginObjectAndNextName` checks that the JSON reader can correctly parse the object and the first name.
2. `testLenientExtraCommasInMaps_NextString` verifies that the next string value is correctly read.
3. `testLenientExtraCommasInMaps_PeekThrowsException` ensures that attempting to peek after an extra comma results in the expected `MalformedJsonException`.

All these methods together cover the same logic and assertions as the original test, ensuring consistency in functionality.
