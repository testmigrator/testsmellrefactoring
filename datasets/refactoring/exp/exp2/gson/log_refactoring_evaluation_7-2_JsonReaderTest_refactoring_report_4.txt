asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The original single test method has been split into two methods, each focusing on a specific part of the test:

1. `testPeekLongMaxValue_Peek()` checks that `reader.peek()` returns `NUMBER`.
2. `testPeekLongMaxValue_NextLong()` checks that `reader.nextLong()` returns `9223372036854775807L`.

Both tests use the `setupTestPeekLongMaxValue()` method to initialize the `JsonReader` and set up the environment, ensuring that the setup is consistent with the original test. The assertions and the overall behavior remain the same, thus maintaining consistency.
