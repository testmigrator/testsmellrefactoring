asserts result: 
 The refactored tests are consistent with the original test in terms of functionality. The main changes involve splitting the original single test into two separate tests to improve clarity and focus on specific conditions:

1. **`testNameAsTopLevelValue_ThrowsExceptionWhenJsonWriterIsClosed`**:
   - This test checks that an `IllegalStateException` is thrown when attempting to write a name after the `JsonWriter` has been closed. This is consistent with the original test.

2. **`testNameAsTopLevelValue_ThrowsExceptionWhenNoObjectStarted`**:
   - This test checks that an `IllegalStateException` is thrown when attempting to write a name without starting an object. This is also consistent with the original test.

Both refactored tests cover the same scenarios as the original test, ensuring that the functionality remains the same. Therefore, the answer is:

**yes**
