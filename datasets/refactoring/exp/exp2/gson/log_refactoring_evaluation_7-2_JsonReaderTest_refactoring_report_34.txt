asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks that the `JsonReader` can parse a semicolon-delimited array in lenient mode and that the booleans read from the array are both `true`. The refactored tests achieve the same goals but split the verification into separate methods:

1. **testLenientSemicolonDelimitedArray_FirstBoolean**: Verifies that the first boolean is `true`.
2. **testLenientSemicolonDelimitedArray_SecondBoolean**: Verifies that the second boolean is `true`.
3. **testLenientSemicolonDelimitedArray_NoExceptionThrown**: Ensures that no exception is thrown when reading the array.

Each of these tests covers the same aspects as the original test, ensuring that the functionality remains consistent.
