asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The main changes include splitting the original single test into two separate tests (`testWriterForAppendable_AppendMethods` and `testWriterForAppendable_WriteStringMethods`) and adding a setup method (`setupTestWriterForAppendable`). These changes do not alter the behavior or the assertions being made in the tests. Each test still performs the same operations and checks the same conditions as the original test, ensuring that the functionality remains consistent.
