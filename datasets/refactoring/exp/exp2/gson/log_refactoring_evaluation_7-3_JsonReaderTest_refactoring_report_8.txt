asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks two things:

1. The default nesting limit is correctly set.
2. An exception is thrown when the nesting limit is exceeded.

The refactored tests split these into two separate tests:

- `testNestingLimitDefault_getNestingLimit` verifies that the default nesting limit is correctly set.
- `testNestingLimitDefault_exceedLimit` verifies that an exception is thrown when the nesting limit is exceeded.

Both refactored tests use the same logic and assertions as the original test, ensuring that the functionality remains consistent. The introduction of helper methods like `createNestedJson` and `setupReaderToLimit` does not alter the behavior but rather improves readability and maintainability.
