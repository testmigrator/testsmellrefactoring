asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each part of the original single test has been broken down into multiple smaller, more focused tests, but the overall behavior and assertions remain consistent. The setup method `setupTestEqualsNonEmptyObject` initializes the objects `a` and `b` in a way that mirrors the initialization in the original test, ensuring that each subsequent test starts from a known state. Each of the refactored tests covers a specific scenario that was also tested in the original test, including initial equality, adding properties, and comparing different values. The use of descriptive test names and assertions also helps to clarify the purpose of each test, maintaining the integrity of the original test's intent.
