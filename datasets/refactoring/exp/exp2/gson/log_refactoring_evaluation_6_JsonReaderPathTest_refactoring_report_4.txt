asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The main changes are:

1. The use of `assertDoesNotThrow` to wrap the entire test logic, which ensures that no unexpected exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test.
2. Adding descriptive messages to the `assertThat` statements for better readability and understanding of what each assertion is checking.

These changes do not alter the core behavior or the assertions being made in the test, so the functionality remains consistent.
