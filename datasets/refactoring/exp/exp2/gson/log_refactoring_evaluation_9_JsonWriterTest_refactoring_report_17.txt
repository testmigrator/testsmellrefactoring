asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is not consistent.

**Inconsistency Overview:**
- **Original Test:** The original test directly checks if calling `jsonWriter.name(null)` throws a `NullPointerException`.
- **Refactored Test:** The refactored test wraps the entire test logic inside an `assertDoesNotThrow` block, which means it will fail if any unexpected exception occurs during the execution of the inner test logic. This changes the behavior because the original test only checks for the `NullPointerException`, while the refactored test also checks that no other exceptions occur before reaching the `assertThrows` statement.

To maintain consistency, the refactored test should directly check for the `NullPointerException` without wrapping it in an `assertDoesNotThrow` block. Here is a corrected version:

```java
@Test
public void testNullName() {
    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();
    JsonWriter jsonWriter = new JsonWriter(stringWriter);
    jsonWriter.beginObject();
    assertThrows(NullPointerException.class, () -> jsonWriter.name(null));
}
```

This ensures that the test only checks for the expected `NullPointerException` and maintains the same functionality as the original test.
