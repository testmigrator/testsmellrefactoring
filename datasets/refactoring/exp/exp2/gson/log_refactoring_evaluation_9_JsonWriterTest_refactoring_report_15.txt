asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is not consistent. The main reason for the inconsistency is the introduction of an additional `assertDoesNotThrow` wrapper around the entire test logic in the refactored version. This change can mask the actual behavior of the test, especially if an unexpected exception occurs before the `assertThrows` call.

### Inconsistency Overview:
- **Original Test**: Directly tests that calling `endArray()` after `beginObject()` results in an `IllegalStateException` with the correct error message.
- **Refactored Test**: Wraps the entire test logic in an `assertDoesNotThrow`, which means that if any unexpected exception occurs before the `assertThrows` call, the test will fail with a generic message, potentially obscuring the root cause of the failure.

To maintain consistency, the refactored test should focus on the specific behavior being tested without introducing additional layers of exception handling that could hide issues. Hereâ€™s a more consistent refactored version:

```java
@Test
public void testBadNestingObject_BeginArrayBeginObjectEndArray() {
    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();
    JsonWriter jsonWriter = new JsonWriter(stringWriter);
    jsonWriter.beginArray();
    jsonWriter.beginObject();
    var e = assertThrows(IllegalStateException.class, () -> jsonWriter.endArray(), "Expected IllegalStateException when ending array after beginning object");
    assertThat(e).hasMessageThat().isEqualTo("Nesting problem.").withFailMessage("Expected nesting problem message to be 'Nesting problem.'");
}
```

This version directly tests the expected behavior without the additional `assertDoesNotThrow` wrapper, ensuring that the test fails with a clear and specific message if the expected exception is not thrown.
