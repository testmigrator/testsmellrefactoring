asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks both equality and hash code equivalence in one method, while the refactored version splits these into two separate methods (`testShortEqualsInteger_Equality` and `testShortEqualsInteger_HashCode`). However, each refactored test still performs the same assertions as the original, ensuring that the `JsonPrimitive` objects are equal and their hash codes are equal. The setup is also moved to a separate method (`setupTestShortEqualsInteger`), which is called by both test methods, maintaining the consistency in the initialization of `p1` and `p2`.
