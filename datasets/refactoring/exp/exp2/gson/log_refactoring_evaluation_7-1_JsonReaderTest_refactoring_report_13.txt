asserts result: 
 yes

The original test and the refactored tests collectively cover the same functionality. The refactored tests break down the original single test into multiple smaller tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of reading the JSON object. Each of the refactored tests ensures that:

1. The JSON object can be started and ended without exceptions.
2. The first key-value pair is read correctly.
3. The second key-value pair is read correctly.
4. The document ends as expected after reading the object.

These aspects together ensure that the overall functionality remains consistent with the original test.
