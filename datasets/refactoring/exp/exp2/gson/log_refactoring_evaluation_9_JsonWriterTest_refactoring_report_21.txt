asserts result: 
 No, the functionality is not consistent.

**Reason for Inconsistency:**
- **Original Test:** The original test calls `assertNonFiniteFloatsExceptions(jsonWriter);` directly, which presumably asserts that certain exceptions are thrown when non-finite floats are encountered in strict mode.
- **Refactored Test:** The refactored test wraps the call to `assertNonFiniteFloatsExceptions(jsonWriter);` inside an `assertThrows` block, which expects an exception to be thrown. This change implies that the test now specifically checks that an exception is thrown when `assertNonFiniteFloatsExceptions` is called.

The original test does not explicitly check for an exception being thrown; it might have its own assertions or handling mechanisms. The refactored test, however, explicitly checks for an exception, which changes the behavior and the purpose of the test. Therefore, the functionality is not consistent between the two versions.
