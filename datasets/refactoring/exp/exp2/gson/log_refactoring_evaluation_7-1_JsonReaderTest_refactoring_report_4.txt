asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The only difference is the addition of a message in the `assertThrows` method call, which does not affect the behavior or outcome of the test. Both tests check that an `IOException` is thrown with the correct message when attempting to read an escaped newline character in strict mode.
