asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The refactored test wraps the assertions in an `assertDoesNotThrow` block, which ensures that no exceptions are thrown during the execution of the lambda. This does not change the core functionality of the test, which still checks:

1. That the serialized map is equal to the original map.
2. That the iteration order of the keys in the serialized map matches the original map.

Additionally, the refactored test includes more descriptive failure messages, which can help in debugging but do not affect the functional correctness of the test.
