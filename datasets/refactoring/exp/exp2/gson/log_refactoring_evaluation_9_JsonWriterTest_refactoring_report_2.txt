asserts result: 
 Yes

The original test and the refactored tests maintain the same functionality. The refactoring splits the original single test into two separate tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `setLenient` method:

1. **testSetLenientTrue_Strictness**: This test checks that setting `setLenient(true)` results in the `getStrictness()` method returning `Strictness.LENIENT`.
2. **testSetLenientTrue_Value**: This test checks that writing a value and closing the `JsonWriter` does not throw an unexpected exception.

Both aspects were covered in the original test, and the refactored tests ensure that these functionalities are still verified. The use of `assertDoesNotThrow` in the refactored tests also ensures that no unexpected exceptions are thrown, which aligns with the original test's behavior.
