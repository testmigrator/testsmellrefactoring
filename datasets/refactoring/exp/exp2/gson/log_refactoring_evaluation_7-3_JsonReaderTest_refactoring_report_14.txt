asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each part of the original test has been broken down into separate methods, but the overall behavior remains consistent. The `setupTestVeryLongUnquotedString` method initializes the `JsonReader` with the necessary setup, and the subsequent tests (`testVeryLongUnquotedString_BeginArray`, `testVeryLongUnquotedString_NextString`, and `testVeryLongUnquotedString_EndArray`) ensure that each step of the original test is performed correctly. The use of `assertDoesNotThrow` ensures that no unexpected exceptions occur during the execution of each step, maintaining the integrity of the original test logic.
