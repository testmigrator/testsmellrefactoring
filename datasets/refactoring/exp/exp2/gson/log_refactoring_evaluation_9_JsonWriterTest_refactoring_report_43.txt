asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The refactored version introduces a `setUp` method to initialize the `StringWriter` and `JsonWriter`, and it encapsulates the array nesting logic into a separate method `writeDeepNestingArrays`. The assertions and the overall behavior remain the same. Therefore, the answer is:

**yes**
