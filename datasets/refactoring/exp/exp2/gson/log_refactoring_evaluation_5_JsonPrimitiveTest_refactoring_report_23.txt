asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version splits the original single test into two separate tests, each focusing on a specific part of the comparison logic. The `setupTestBigDecimalEquals` method initializes the necessary variables, and the two test methods (`testBigDecimalEquals_SmallVsLarge` and `testBigDecimalEquals_SmallDecimalVsLargeDecimal`) perform the same assertions as the original test. The assertions and the logic remain the same, ensuring that the behavior of the tests is consistent.
