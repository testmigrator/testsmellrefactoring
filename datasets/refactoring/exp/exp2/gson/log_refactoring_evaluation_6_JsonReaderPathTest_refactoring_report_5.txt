asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The refactored test uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure that no exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test, which is a reasonable change to make the test more robust. The assertions and the logic flow remain the same, ensuring that the test still verifies the same conditions as the original test.
