asserts result: 
 The refactored test is consistent with the original test. Both tests aim to verify that a `MalformedJsonException` is thrown when attempting to read a JSON string with an unterminated escape sequence. The main changes in the refactored version include:

1. **Simplified Exception Handling**: The refactored test uses a lambda expression within `assertThrows` to make the code more concise.
2. **Enhanced Error Message**: The refactored test includes an additional `withFailMessage` method call to provide a more detailed failure message if the assertion fails.

These changes do not alter the core functionality of the test. Therefore, the answer is:

**yes**
