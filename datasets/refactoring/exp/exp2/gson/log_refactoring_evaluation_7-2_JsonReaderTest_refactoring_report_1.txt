asserts result: 
 The refactored test code is not consistent with the original test code. The key difference lies in the use of `assertDoesNotThrow` in the refactored code, which is incorrect for this context. The original test uses `assertNotANumber`, which likely expects an exception to be thrown when the input is not a valid number. By using `assertDoesNotThrow`, the refactored code is checking that no exception is thrown, which is the opposite of what the original test intended.

### Inconsistent Tests:
- **All tests** in the refactored code are inconsistent because they check for the absence of exceptions, whereas the original tests expect exceptions for malformed numbers.

### Reason for Inconsistency:
- The original test cases are designed to verify that certain inputs are not valid numbers, which typically means that an exception should be thrown when these inputs are processed.
- The refactored test cases, however, use `assertDoesNotThrow`, which checks that no exception is thrown. This change in behavior means that the refactored tests will pass if no exception is thrown, even though the original tests expected an exception.

To make the refactored code consistent with the original, you should use `assertThrows` instead of `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure that the expected exceptions are indeed thrown for each malformed number.
