asserts result: 
 The refactored tests are consistent with the original test in terms of functionality. Each refactored test covers a part of the original test, ensuring that the same conditions and outcomes are verified:

1. `testNameInArray_ThrowsExceptionBeforeObject` checks that calling `name()` before starting an object throws an `IllegalStateException`.
2. `testNameInArray_ThrowsExceptionAfterValue` checks that calling `name()` after writing a value but before starting an object also throws an `IllegalStateException`.
3. `testNameInArray_WritesCorrectJson` ensures that the JSON output is correct when the array is properly constructed without calling `name()`.

All the critical behaviors and error conditions from the original test are preserved in the refactored tests. Therefore, the answer is:

yes
