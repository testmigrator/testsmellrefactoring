asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. Both tests perform the following steps:
1. Create a `JsonReader` instance from the JSON string `[1,2,3]`.
2. Begin reading the array.
3. Skip the first two values in the array.
4. Assert that the previous path is `$[1]`.
5. Assert that the current path is `$[2]`.

The main differences are:
- The refactored test uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure no unexpected exceptions occur during the execution of the `beginArray` and `skipValue` methods.
- The refactored test includes more descriptive messages in the assertions for better readability and debugging.

These changes do not alter the core functionality of the test. Therefore, the functionality is consistent between the original and refactored tests.
