asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is not consistent. 

**Inconsistency Overview:**
- **Original Test:** The original test directly checks that calling `jsonWriter.name("a")` a second time within the same object context throws an `IllegalStateException` with the expected message.
- **Refactored Test:** The refactored test wraps the entire operation inside an `assertDoesNotThrow`, which is incorrect because it expects the entire block to not throw any exceptions. This means that if an `IllegalStateException` is thrown as expected, the test will fail.

To make the refactored test consistent with the original, the `assertDoesNotThrow` should be removed, and the `assertThrows` should be used directly to check for the `IllegalStateException`.

**Corrected Refactored Test:**
```java
@Test
public void testTwoNames_NameAlreadyWritten() {
    StringWriter stringWriter = createStringWriter();
    JsonWriter jsonWriter = createJsonWriter(stringWriter);

    jsonWriter.beginObject();
    jsonWriter.name("a");

    IllegalStateException exception = assertThrows(IllegalStateException.class, () -> {
        jsonWriter.name("a");
    }, "Expected IllegalStateException when trying to write a name after another name has already been written");

    assertThat(exception.getMessage()).isEqualTo("Already wrote a name, expecting a value.");
}
```

This corrected version ensures that the functionality remains consistent with the original test.
