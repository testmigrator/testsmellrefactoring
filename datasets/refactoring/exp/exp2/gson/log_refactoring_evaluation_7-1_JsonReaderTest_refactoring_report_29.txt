asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. Both tests:

1. Set up a JSON string with an invalid Unicode escape sequence.
2. Create a `JsonReader` instance from the JSON string.
3. Begin reading an array from the JSON.
4. Assert that calling `nextString()` on the `JsonReader` throws a `MalformedJsonException`.
5. Verify that the exception message matches the expected message.

The changes in the refactored version are primarily stylistic and do not alter the behavior of the test. The addition of comments for clarity and the use of a lambda expression in `assertThrows` do not affect the test's functionality.
