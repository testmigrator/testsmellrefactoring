asserts result: 
 yes

The original test and the refactored tests maintain the same functionality. The refactored version splits the original test into two separate methods, each focusing on a specific aspect of the test:

1. `testEqualsHashCodeIgnoringOrder_KeySetOrder` checks the order of the key sets for objects `a` and `b`.
2. `testEqualsHashCodeIgnoringOrder_EqualsAndHashCode` checks the equality and hash code of objects `a` and `b`.

Both aspects are covered in the original test, and the refactored version ensures that these checks are still performed, maintaining the overall functionality.
