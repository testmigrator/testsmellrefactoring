asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each of the refactored tests checks a specific part of the original test:

- `testSkipArray_NameA` checks that the first name is "a".
- `testSkipArray_NameB` checks that the second name is "b" and the integer value is 123.
- `testSkipArray_EndDocument` checks that the document ends correctly with `END_DOCUMENT`.

Together, these tests cover all the assertions made in the original test, ensuring that the functionality remains consistent.
