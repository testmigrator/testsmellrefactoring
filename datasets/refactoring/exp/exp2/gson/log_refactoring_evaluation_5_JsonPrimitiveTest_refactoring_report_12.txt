asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the original functionality. The setup method `setupTestShortEqualsLong` initializes the `JsonPrimitive` objects, and the two test methods `testShortEqualsLong_Equality` and `testShortEqualsLong_HashCode` each check one aspect of the equality and hash code, respectively. This separation of concerns ensures that the tests are clear and focused, while still covering the same functionality as the original single test method.
