asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each scenario from the original test has been split into separate test methods, each focusing on a specific case of lenient unnecessary array separators. The use of `createLenientReader` to initialize the `JsonReader` with the correct strictness setting ensures that the behavior remains consistent across all scenarios. Additionally, the use of `assertDoesNotThrow` in the refactored tests provides an extra layer of validation to ensure that no unexpected exceptions occur, which aligns with the original test's implicit assumption that these operations should not throw exceptions under lenient mode.
