asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each of the refactored tests (`testSkipObjectNameUnquoted_SkipValue`, `testSkipObjectNameUnquoted_GetPath`, `testSkipObjectNameUnquoted_ReadInt`) checks a part of the original test's assertions, and together they cover all the assertions made in the original `testSkipObjectNameUnquoted` method. The setup is moved to a separate method (`setupTestSkipObjectNameUnquoted`), which is called by each of the refactored tests, ensuring that the initial state is the same as in the original test.
