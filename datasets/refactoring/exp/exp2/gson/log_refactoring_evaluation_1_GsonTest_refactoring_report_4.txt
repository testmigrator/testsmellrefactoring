asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is not entirely consistent. Here’s a breakdown:

### Inconsistencies:

1. **`testNewJsonWriter_Default_ThrowsExceptionOnAdditionalTopLevelValue`**:
   - **Reason**: In the original test, the `IllegalStateException` is thrown when attempting to write an additional top-level value after the JSON object has been written and closed. However, in the refactored test, the `JsonWriter` is re-created using `new Gson().newJsonWriter(writer)` inside the lambda expression, which means it starts a new JSON writing process on the same `StringWriter`. This does not accurately replicate the original scenario where the `JsonWriter` was already used to write the JSON object and then attempted to write another top-level value.

### Suggested Fix:
To make the refactored test consistent with the original, the `JsonWriter` instance should be reused from the `setupTestNewJsonWriter_Default` method instead of creating a new one. Here’s how you can modify the test:

```java
@Test
public void testNewJsonWriter_Default_ThrowsExceptionOnAdditionalTopLevelValue() {
    StringWriter writer = setupTestNewJsonWriter_Default();
    JsonWriter jsonWriter = new Gson().newJsonWriter(writer);

    IllegalStateException exception = assertThrows(IllegalStateException.class, () -> {
        jsonWriter.value(1);
    });
    // "Exception message should indicate only one top-level value is allowed"
    assertThat(exception).hasMessageThat().isEqualTo("JSON must have only one top-level value.");
}
```

However, this approach still has a flaw because the `JsonWriter` instance is not the same one that was used to write the initial JSON object. To truly replicate the original behavior, you would need to pass the `JsonWriter` instance through the `setupTestNewJsonWriter_Default` method or store it in a field.

### Corrected Refactoring:
Here’s a more accurate refactoring that maintains the original behavior:

```java
private JsonWriter setupTestNewJsonWriter_Default() {
    StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
    JsonWriter jsonWriter = null;
    try {
        jsonWriter = new Gson().newJsonWriter(writer);
        jsonWriter.beginObject();
        jsonWriter.name("test");
        jsonWriter.nullValue();
        jsonWriter.name("<test2");
        jsonWriter.value(true);
        jsonWriter.endObject();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
    return jsonWriter;
}

@Test
public void testNewJsonWriter_Default_WritesCorrectJson() {
    JsonWriter jsonWriter = setupTestNewJsonWriter_Default();
    String actualValue = jsonWriter.getWriter().toString();
    // "JSON output should match expected format"
    assertThat(actualValue).isEqualTo("{\"\\u003ctest2\":true}");
}

@Test
public void testNewJsonWriter_Default_ThrowsExceptionOnAdditionalTopLevelValue() {
    JsonWriter jsonWriter = setupTestNewJsonWriter_Default();

    IllegalStateException exception = assertThrows(IllegalStateException.class, () -> {
        jsonWriter.value(1);
    });
    // "Exception message should indicate only one top-level value is allowed"
    assertThat(exception).hasMessageThat().isEqualTo("JSON must have only one top-level value.");
}
```

In this corrected version, the `setupTestNewJsonWriter_Default` method returns the `JsonWriter` instance, which is then used in both tests to ensure consistency with the original behavior.
