asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent.

**Reasoning:**
- Both tests aim to verify that the `JsonReader` correctly identifies a non-digit exponent in a string as a `STRING` token when the strictness is set to `LENIENT`.
- The original test uses `assertThat(reader.peek()).isEqualTo(STRING)` to check the token type.
- The refactored test uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure no unexpected exceptions are thrown and then checks the token type with `assertThat(reader.peek()).isEqualTo(JsonToken.STRING)`.
- The use of `assertDoesNotThrow` in the refactored test adds an additional layer of validation to ensure that no exceptions are thrown, but this does not change the core functionality of the test.

Therefore, the refactored test maintains the same functional behavior as the original test. 

**Answer:**
yes
