asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks two things:

1. It reads the first character and expects it to be `")"`.
2. It then attempts to read the next string and expects a `MalformedJsonException` to be thrown with a specific error message.

The refactored tests split these checks into two separate methods:

1. `testLenientPartialNonExecutePrefix_ReadFirstCharacter` ensures that the first character is read correctly.
2. `testLenientPartialNonExecutePrefix_ThrowsExceptionOnSecondRead` ensures that attempting to read the second string throws the expected `MalformedJsonException` with the correct error message.

Both the original and refactored tests cover the same scenarios and verify the same conditions, so the functionality is consistent.
