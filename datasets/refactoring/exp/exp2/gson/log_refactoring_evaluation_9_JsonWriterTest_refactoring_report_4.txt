The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test sets the strictness of the `JsonWriter`, writes a boolean value, and then closes the writer, while checking that the strictness is correctly set. The refactored tests break down these steps into separate test methods, each verifying a specific part of the process:

1. `testSetStrictness_SettingStrictness` checks that the strictness is set correctly.
2. `testSetStrictness_WritingValue` verifies that writing a value does not throw an unexpected exception.
3. `testSetStrictness_ClosingWriter` ensures that closing the writer does not throw an unexpected exception.

Each of these tests uses the `setupTestSetStrictness` method to initialize the `JsonWriter` with the correct strictness setting, ensuring that the setup is consistent across all tests. This refactoring improves the readability and maintainability of the tests without changing their overall functionality.
