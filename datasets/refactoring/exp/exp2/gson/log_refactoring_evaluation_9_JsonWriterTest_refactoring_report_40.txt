asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version breaks down the original test into three parts, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `testEmptyObject` method:

1. **`testEmptyObject_BeginObject`**: Ensures that the `beginObject` method can be called without throwing an exception.
2. **`testEmptyObject_EndObject`**: Ensures that the `endObject` method can be called without throwing an exception.
3. **`testEmptyObject_ExpectedOutput`**: Ensures that the final output is as expected, i.e., `{}`.

Each part of the refactored tests collectively ensures that the same functionality is tested as in the original test. Therefore, the answer is:

**yes**
