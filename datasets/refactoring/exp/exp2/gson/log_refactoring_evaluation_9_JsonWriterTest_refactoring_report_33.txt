asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored version is consistent. The refactoring primarily involves breaking down the original `testMalformedNumbers` method into two methods: `testMalformedNumbers` and `testMalformedNumber`. This change does not alter the behavior or the assertions being made. The error messages and the logic for throwing and catching exceptions remain the same, ensuring that the tests will still validate the same conditions and produce the same results.
