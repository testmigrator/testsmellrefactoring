asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests cover all the steps and assertions present in the original test method `testSkipArrayAfterPeek`. Each step from the original test is now encapsulated in its own test method, ensuring that the same sequence of operations and validations are performed. The functionality remains consistent as each refactored test method checks a specific part of the original test, maintaining the overall behavior and expected outcomes.
