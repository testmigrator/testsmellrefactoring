asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks both the equality and hash code of two `JsonPrimitive` objects. In the refactored version, this has been split into two separate test methods, each focusing on one aspect (equality and hash code), but both aspects are still being tested. The use of a setup method (`setupTestByteEqualsLong`) ensures that the initial state of the objects is the same as in the original test. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
