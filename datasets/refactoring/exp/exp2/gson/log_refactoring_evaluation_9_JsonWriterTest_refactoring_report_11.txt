asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is not consistent. Hereâ€™s an overview of the reasons for the inconsistency:

1. **Use of `assertDoesNotThrow`**: In the refactored code, `assertDoesNotThrow` is used to wrap the entire block of code. This means that the test will pass if no exception is thrown at all, which contradicts the original intent of the test, which is to ensure that an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

2. **Redundant Exception Handling**: The refactored code uses both `assertDoesNotThrow` and `assertThrows` within the same block, which is logically inconsistent. The `assertThrows` method is designed to ensure that a specific exception is thrown, while `assertDoesNotThrow` ensures that no exception is thrown. Using both in the same context is redundant and can lead to confusion.

3. **Message Assertions**: The refactored code includes additional message assertions using `withFailMessage`, which were not present in the original test. While these messages can be helpful for debugging, they change the behavior of the test by providing more detailed failure messages.

To make the refactored test consistent with the original, you should remove the `assertDoesNotThrow` and keep only the `assertThrows` with the appropriate message assertion. Here is a corrected version:

```java
@Test
public void testValueWithoutName() {
    StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();
    JsonWriter jsonWriter = new JsonWriter(stringWriter);
    jsonWriter.beginObject();

    IllegalStateException exception = assertThrows(IllegalStateException.class, () -> {
        jsonWriter.value(true);
    }, "Expected IllegalStateException when calling value without name");

    assertThat(exception.getMessage()).isEqualTo("Nesting problem.").withFailMessage("Expected message 'Nesting problem.' when calling value without name");
}
```

This version maintains the original intent of the test while adding the additional message for clarity.
