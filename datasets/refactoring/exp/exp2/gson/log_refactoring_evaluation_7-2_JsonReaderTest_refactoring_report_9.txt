asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks both the token type and the integer value in a single method, while the refactored version splits these checks into two separate methods (`testQuotedNumberWithEscape_PeekString` and `testQuotedNumberWithEscape_ReadInt`). However, both the original and refactored versions perform the same assertions:

1. **Token Type Check**: Both check that the token type is `STRING`.
2. **Integer Value Check**: Both check that the integer value read from the JSON is `1234`.

The refactoring improves readability and separation of concerns without changing the overall functionality.
