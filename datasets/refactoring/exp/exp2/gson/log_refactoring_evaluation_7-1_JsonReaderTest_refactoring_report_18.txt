asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original and refactored test cases is consistent. Both tests aim to verify that the `skipValue` method on the `JsonReader` object correctly skips over the top-level JSON object, leaving the reader positioned at the end of the document (`JsonToken.END_DOCUMENT`). The main difference is in the way exceptions are handled:

- In the original test, the method signature includes `throws Exception`, indicating that any exceptions thrown during the execution of the test will be propagated up.
- In the refactored test, the `assertDoesNotThrow` method is used to wrap the code block that might throw an exception, providing a more specific assertion about the expected behavior (i.e., no exception should be thrown).

This change does not affect the core functionality being tested, so the tests are functionally equivalent.
