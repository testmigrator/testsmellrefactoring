asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The changes made in the refactored version do not alter the core behavior of the test. Both versions:

1. Create a `JsonReader` instance with a JSON string containing a number with a truncated exponent.
2. Set the strictness of the reader to `LENIENT`.
3. Begin reading an array.
4. Assert that the next token is a string.

The only difference is the use of `assertDoesNotThrow` in the refactored version to ensure that no unexpected exceptions occur during the test execution. This change does not affect the primary functionality being tested.

Therefore, the answer is: **yes**
