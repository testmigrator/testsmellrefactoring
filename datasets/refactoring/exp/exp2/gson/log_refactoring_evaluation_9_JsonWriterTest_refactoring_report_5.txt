asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks that a `NullPointerException` is thrown when `setStrictness(null)` is called, and then it proceeds to call `value(false)` and `close()` without expecting any exceptions. The refactored tests split this into two separate tests:

1. `testSetStrictnessNull_Exception` checks that a `NullPointerException` is thrown when `setStrictness(null)` is called.
2. `testSetStrictnessNull_NoExceptionOnValueAndClose` checks that no exceptions are thrown when `value(false)` and `close()` are called.

Both sets of tests ensure that the expected behavior is maintained, so the functionality is consistent.
