asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original single test has been split into two separate tests to better isolate the GET and POST methods. Each test now focuses on one specific aspect of the functionality, which improves readability and maintainability. The setup common to both tests has been extracted into a private method `setupTestCreatesSubmitableConnection`, ensuring that the setup logic is not duplicated. This refactoring does not alter the behavior or the assertions made in the original test.
