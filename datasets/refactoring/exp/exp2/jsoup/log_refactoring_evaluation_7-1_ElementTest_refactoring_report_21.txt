asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests cover the same functionality as the original test, breaking it down into three separate methods for clarity and modularity. Each refactored method tests a specific operation (`addClass`, `removeClass`, `toggleClass`) and ensures that the expected changes to the class names are applied correctly. The assertions and the logic within each method match the corresponding parts of the original test, ensuring consistency in functionality.
