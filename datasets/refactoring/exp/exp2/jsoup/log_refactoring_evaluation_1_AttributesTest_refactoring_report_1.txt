asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests cover all the assertions from the original test method `html()`. Each assertion from the original test has been moved into separate test methods (`testHtml_Size`, `testHtml_HasKey`, `testHtml_Dataset`, `testHtml_HtmlRepresentation`), and the functionality tested remains consistent. The setup of the `Attributes` object is now encapsulated in the `setupAttributes` method, which is called by each test method to ensure that the same initial state is used for testing. This refactoring improves readability and maintainability without altering the behavior or coverage of the tests.
