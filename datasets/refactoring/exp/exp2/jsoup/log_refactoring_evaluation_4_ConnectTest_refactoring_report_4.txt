asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily structural, such as wrapping the `Jsoup.connect` call in a try-catch block to handle potential `IOException` and using `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure no unexpected exceptions occur. The assertions and their logic remain consistent, ensuring that the test still verifies the same conditions.
