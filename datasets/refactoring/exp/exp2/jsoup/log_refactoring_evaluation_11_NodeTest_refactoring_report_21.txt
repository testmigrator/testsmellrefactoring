asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each aspect of the original test is now covered by a separate test method, ensuring that all checks are performed:

1. **testChildNodesCopy_Size**: Verifies that the size of the copied child nodes matches the expected size.
2. **testChildNodesCopy_TextNodeUpdate**: Ensures that updating the text of a copied text node does not affect the original text node.
3. **testChildNodesCopy_InsertChildren**: Checks that inserting the copied child nodes into another element results in the expected HTML structure.

All assertions and operations in the refactored tests are consistent with those in the original test.
