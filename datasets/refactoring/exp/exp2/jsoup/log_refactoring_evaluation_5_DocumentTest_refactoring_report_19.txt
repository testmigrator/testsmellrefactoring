asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original single test has been split into multiple tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `testMetaCharsetUpdateXmlUtf8` function. Each of the new tests calls the `setupTestMetaCharsetUpdateXmlUtf8` method to prepare the document, ensuring that the setup is consistent across all tests. The assertions in the refactored tests cover the same checks as the original test, verifying the document's string representation, the encoding attribute of the XML declaration, the document charset, and the output settings charset. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
