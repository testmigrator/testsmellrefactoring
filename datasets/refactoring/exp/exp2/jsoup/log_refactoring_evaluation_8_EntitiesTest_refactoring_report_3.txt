asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original single test method has been split into three methods, each focusing on a specific part of the test:

1. `testUnescapeMultiChars_Unescape` checks if the unescaping process works correctly.
2. `testUnescapeMultiChars_Escape` checks if the escaping process works correctly.
3. `testUnescapeMultiChars_RoundTrip` checks if the round-trip (escaping followed by unescaping) results in the original text.

Each of these methods performs the same assertions as the original test, ensuring that the functionality remains consistent.
