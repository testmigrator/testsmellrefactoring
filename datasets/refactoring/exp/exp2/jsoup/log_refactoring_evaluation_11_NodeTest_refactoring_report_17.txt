asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original and refactored tests is consistent. The only changes in the refactored version are the addition of descriptive messages to the `assertEquals` and `assertTrue` assertions, which do not affect the behavior or outcome of the test. Both versions check that the HTML content after unwrapping the `<span>` element matches the expected output and that the returned node is `null`.
