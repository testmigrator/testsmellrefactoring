asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily to improve readability and robustness, such as:

- Using `@TempDir` to handle temporary directories.
- Adding a check to ensure the input file exists and is of the expected type.
- Providing more descriptive error messages in the assertions.

These changes do not alter the core functionality of the test, which is to verify the title, language attribute, and the number of elements in the article body.
