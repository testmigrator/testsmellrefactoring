asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original single test method has been split into two separate methods, each focusing on a specific assertion. However, both assertions (checking if the attribute exists and verifying its value) are still performed, ensuring that the overall functionality remains consistent. The introduction of the `setupLiteralAbsPrefix` method does not alter the behavior but rather improves the readability and maintainability of the tests.
