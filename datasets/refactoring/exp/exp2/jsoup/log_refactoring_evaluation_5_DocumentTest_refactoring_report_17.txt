asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The only changes made are the addition of descriptive messages to the `assertEquals` and `assertTrue` assertions. These messages do not alter the behavior or the outcome of the tests; they merely provide additional information in case the assertions fail.
