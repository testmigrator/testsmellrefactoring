asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The only changes made in the refactored version are the addition of descriptive messages to the `assertEquals` statements, which do not alter the behavior or the outcome of the tests. These messages provide better context in case of test failures but do not affect the test logic or results.
