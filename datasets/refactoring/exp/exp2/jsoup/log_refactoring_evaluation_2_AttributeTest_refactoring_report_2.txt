asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The original single test method has been split into two separate methods, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `Attribute` object's behavior (`html()` and `toString()`). The setup logic for creating the `Attribute` object is now encapsulated in a helper method `setupTestWithSupplementaryCharacterInAttributeKeyAndValue()`, which is called by both test methods. This refactoring does not change the behavior or the assertions being made, ensuring that the functionality remains consistent.
