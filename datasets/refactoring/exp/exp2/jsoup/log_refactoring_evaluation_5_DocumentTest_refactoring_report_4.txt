asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The refactoring primarily involves moving the document parsing into a separate method (`setupTestXhtmlReferences`), which is called within the test method. This change does not alter the behavior or the outcome of the test. The `assertEquals` statement remains the same, ensuring that the output of the document's body HTML is still being validated against the expected string.
