asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version splits the original test into two separate tests but maintains the same logic and assertions:

1. **testSizeWithRegularAttributes**: This test checks that the size of the `Attributes` object is 2 after adding two regular attributes, which matches the first part of the original test.

2. **testSizeWithInternalAttributes**: This test checks that the size of the `Attributes` object remains 2 even after adding two internal attributes, which matches the second part of the original test.

Both the original and refactored tests ensure that the size of the `Attributes` object does not change when internal attributes are added, maintaining the same behavior and assertions.
