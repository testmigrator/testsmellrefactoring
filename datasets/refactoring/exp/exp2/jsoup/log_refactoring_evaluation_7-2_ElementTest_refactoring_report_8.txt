asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The original single test method has been broken down into three separate methods, each focusing on a specific part of the functionality:

1. `testInsertChildrenAtPosition_InitialChildNodeSize` checks the initial state of `div2`.
2. `testInsertChildrenAtPosition_InsertPElements` tests the insertion of `<p>` elements from `div1` into `div2`.
3. `testInsertChildrenAtPosition_InsertCustomNodes` tests the insertion of custom nodes into `div2`.

Each refactored test method performs the same assertions as the original test, ensuring that the behavior remains consistent. The refactoring improves readability and maintainability without altering the intended functionality.
