asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each part of the original test has been broken down into separate test methods, each focusing on a specific aspect (testing elements with the class "mellow," "yellow," and "solo" respectively). The setup of the HTML document is now done in a separate method (`setupTestGetElementsWithClass`), which is called by each test method. This refactoring does not change the behavior or the assertions made in the tests.
