asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original single test has been split into three separate tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `clone` method:

1. **testClone_OrphanedClone**: Verifies that the cloned element is orphaned and has the correct sibling index and parent.
2. **testClone_AppendChild**: Verifies that appending a child to the cloned element does not modify the original document.
3. **testClone_AdoptClone**: Verifies that adopting the cloned element into the document updates its parent and modifies the document as expected.

Each of these tests covers the same assertions as the original test, ensuring that the functionality remains consistent.
