asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The only changes are in the addition of descriptive messages to the `assertEquals` assertions, which do not alter the behavior or outcome of the test. The test still checks that the document string matches the expected XML charset and that the attributes of the XML declaration node (`encoding` and `version`) remain as "dontTouch".
