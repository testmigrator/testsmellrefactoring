asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. It has been split into two separate tests for better clarity and organization:

1. `testChildThrowsIndexOutOfBoundsOnMissing_Setup` checks the initial conditions (number of children and the text of the first child) to ensure the setup is correct.
2. `testChildThrowsIndexOutOfBoundsOnMissing_Exception` specifically tests that an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown when trying to access a non-existent child element.

Both tests together cover the same scenarios as the original single test, ensuring consistency in functionality.
