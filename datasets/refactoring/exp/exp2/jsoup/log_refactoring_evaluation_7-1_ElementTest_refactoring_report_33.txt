asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each part of the original test has been broken down into separate test methods, but the operations performed and the assertions made are consistent with the original. The setup method `setupTestSetHtmlTitle` initializes the document in the same way as the original test, and each of the new test methods performs the same actions and checks the same conditions as the corresponding parts of the original test.
