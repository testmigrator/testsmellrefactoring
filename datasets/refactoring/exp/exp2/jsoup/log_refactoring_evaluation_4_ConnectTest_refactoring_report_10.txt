asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The primary changes are:

1. Wrapping the test logic inside an `assertDoesNotThrow` block to ensure that no unexpected exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test.
2. Adding descriptive messages to the `assertEquals` assertions to provide more context in case of assertion failures.

These changes do not alter the core behavior or the expected outcomes of the test. Therefore, the functionality remains consistent.
