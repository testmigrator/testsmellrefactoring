asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The primary changes include:

1. Wrapping the test body in an `assertDoesNotThrow` method to ensure that no unexpected exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test.
2. Adding more descriptive messages to the `assertEquals` assertions to provide clearer feedback when a test fails.

These changes do not alter the core functionality or the expected outcomes of the test. The test still:
- Sets up a connection with specific parameters.
- Executes the connection and retrieves the response.
- Verifies that the cookies set by the redirect are correct.
- Sends the cookies to the echo URL and verifies the `Cookie` header in the response.
