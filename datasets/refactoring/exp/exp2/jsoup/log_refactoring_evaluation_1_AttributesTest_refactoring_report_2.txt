The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks the behavior of removing an element from an `Attributes` object using an iterator and verifies the state of the `Attributes` object before and after the removal. The refactored tests break this down into multiple, more focused tests, but they collectively cover the same aspects:

1. **Initial State**: Ensures the `Attributes` object is correctly initialized.
2. **Initial Attributes**: Verifies that each attribute is present with the correct value.
3. **Remove First Element**: Checks that the first element is removed correctly and the size of the `Attributes` object is updated.
4. **Check Remaining Elements**: Verifies the state of the remaining elements after the first element is removed.
5. **Final State**: Confirms the final state of the `Attributes` object, ensuring the removed element is no longer present and the remaining elements are intact.

All these tests together ensure that the functionality remains consistent with the original test.
