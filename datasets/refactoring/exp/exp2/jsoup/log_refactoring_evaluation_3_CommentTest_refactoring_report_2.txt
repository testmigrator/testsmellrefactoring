asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The only changes made are the addition of descriptive messages to the `assertEquals` method calls, which do not alter the behavior or outcome of the tests. These messages provide additional context in case the assertions fail, but they do not affect the logic or the results of the tests.
