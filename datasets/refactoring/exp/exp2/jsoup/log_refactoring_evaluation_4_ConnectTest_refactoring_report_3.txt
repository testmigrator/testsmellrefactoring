asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test code maintains the same functionality as the original test code. The primary changes include the addition of an `assertDoesNotThrow` method to handle potential exceptions during the POST request and the inclusion of descriptive messages for each assertion. These changes do not alter the core behavior or the expected outcomes of the test.
