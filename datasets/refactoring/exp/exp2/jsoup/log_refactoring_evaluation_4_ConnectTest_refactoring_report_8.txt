asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The primary changes include:

1. **Exception Handling**: The refactored test uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure that no unexpected exceptions occur during the POST request. This is a more explicit way to handle potential exceptions compared to the original test, which implicitly assumes no exceptions will occur.

2. **Assert Messages**: The refactored test includes detailed messages in the `assertEquals` assertions, which can help in debugging if the test fails.

3. **Code Readability**: The refactored test improves readability by separating the exception handling from the assertions.

These changes do not alter the core functionality of the test, which is to verify that the POST request is sent correctly with the specified body and URL parameters. Therefore, the functionality remains consistent.
