asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The only difference is that the setup of the `Attributes` object has been moved to a separate method (`setupTestIteratorEmpty`). This change does not affect the outcome of the test, as the `Attributes` object is still initialized and used in the same way to check if the iterator is empty.
