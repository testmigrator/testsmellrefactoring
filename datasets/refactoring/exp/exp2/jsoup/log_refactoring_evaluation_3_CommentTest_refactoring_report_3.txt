asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests cover all the assertions made in the original test method, and they are logically equivalent. Each of the new test methods focuses on a specific aspect of the `clone` method, ensuring that:

1. The cloned object is not the same instance as the original (`testClone_ObjectIdentity`).
2. The data in the cloned object is initially equal to the data in the original object (`testClone_DataEquality`).
3. The data in the cloned object can be modified independently of the original object (`testClone_DataMutability`).

These aspects are all tested in the original `testClone` method, so the functionality remains consistent.
