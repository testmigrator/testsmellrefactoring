asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks the following:

1. The initial HTML matches the outer HTML of the selected paragraph.
2. The HTML remains unchanged when accessed from a different thread.
3. The charset is correctly set to US-ASCII after the thread execution.
4. The final HTML is correctly encoded in ASCII.

The refactored tests achieve these same checks but split the process into two separate tests for better readability and modularity:

- `testParseAndHtmlOnDifferentThreads_InitialHTML` checks that the initial HTML matches the expected value.
- `testParseAndHtmlOnDifferentThreads_ThreadOutput` checks the thread execution, charset setting, and final ASCII-encoded HTML.

Both sets of tests ensure that the document is correctly parsed, the thread executes without errors, and the final HTML is correctly encoded. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
