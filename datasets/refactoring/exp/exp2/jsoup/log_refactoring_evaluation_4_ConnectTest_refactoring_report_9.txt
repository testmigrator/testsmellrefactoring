asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes include:

1. **Encapsulation of `echoUrl`**: Moved to a private field for better readability and reusability.
2. **Use of `assertDoesNotThrow`**: Added to ensure that no unexpected exceptions are thrown during the test execution.
3. **Detailed Assertion Messages**: Added messages to each `assertEquals` call to provide more context in case of failures.

These changes do not alter the core behavior or the assertions being made in the test. Therefore, the functionality remains consistent.
