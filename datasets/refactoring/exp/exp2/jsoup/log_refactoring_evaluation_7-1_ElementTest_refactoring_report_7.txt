asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily structural, breaking the single test method into a setup method and two separate test methods, each focusing on a specific assertion. This does not alter the behavior or the outcome of the tests. Both the original and refactored versions check that the text content and HTML structure of the document match the expected values.
