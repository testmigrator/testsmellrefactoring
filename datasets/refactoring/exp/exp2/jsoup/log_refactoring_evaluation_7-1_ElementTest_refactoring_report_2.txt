asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each aspect of the original test (element count, ID, and tag name) is now verified in separate test methods, but the overall behavior and assertions remain consistent. The use of constants for expected values and a setup method for common initialization does not alter the intended functionality of the tests.
