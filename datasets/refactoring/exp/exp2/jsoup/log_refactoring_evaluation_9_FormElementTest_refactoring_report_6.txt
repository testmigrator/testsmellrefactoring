asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks two things:
1. The form element is an instance of `FormElement`.
2. The form contains exactly one input element.

In the refactored version, these checks are split into two separate tests:
- `testFormsAddedAfterParseAreFormElements_IsInstanceOfFormElement` checks that the form element is an instance of `FormElement`.
- `testFormsAddedAfterParseAreFormElements_HasOneInputElement` checks that the form contains exactly one input element.

Both the original and refactored tests perform the same assertions, so the functionality is consistent.
