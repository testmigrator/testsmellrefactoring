asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test `handlesAbsPrefix` has been split into three separate tests, each focusing on a specific aspect of the functionality:

1. `testHandlesAbsPrefix_HrefAttribute` checks that the `href` attribute is correctly set to `/foo`.
2. `testHandlesAbsPrefix_AbsHrefAttribute` verifies that the `abs:href` attribute resolves to `https://jsoup.org/foo`.
3. `testHandlesAbsPrefix_HasAbsHrefAttribute` ensures that the `abs:href` attribute exists.

Each of these tests calls a common setup method `setupHandlesAbsPrefix`, which initializes the `Document` and `Element` objects used in the tests. This refactoring does not change the behavior or the assertions made in the original test. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
