The refactored tests cover the same functionality as the original test, breaking down the single test into multiple focused tests. Each of the refactored tests checks specific aspects of the `clone` method:

1. **testClone_ObjectIdentity**: Ensures that the cloned object is not the same instance as the original.
2. **testClone_InitialContentEquality**: Verifies that the cloned object has the same initial content as the original.
3. **testClone_ModifiedContentDifference**: Checks that modifying the cloned object's text changes its content, while the original object remains unchanged.
4. **testClone_AttributesImpact**: Confirms that calling `attributes()` on the original object does not affect the cloned object, and that modifying the cloned object's text does not affect the original object.

All these tests together ensure that the behavior of the `clone` method is consistent with the original test.
