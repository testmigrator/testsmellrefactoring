asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test method `testRoundTrip` maintains the same functionality as the original test method. The only changes introduced are the addition of descriptive messages to the `assertEquals` assertions, which do not alter the behavior or the outcome of the tests. These messages provide better context in case of assertion failures, but they do not affect the consistency of the test's functionality.
