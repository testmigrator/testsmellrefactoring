asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks the following:

1. The HTML structure after unwrapping the `<span>` tag.
2. The type of the unwrapped node.
3. The text content of the unwrapped node.
4. The identity of the unwrapped node compared to the original child node.
5. The parent of the unwrapped node.

The refactored tests split these checks into two separate methods (`testUnwrap_ReturnsCorrectHtmlStructure` and `testUnwrap_ReturnsCorrectNode`), but each of these methods still verifies the same conditions as the original test. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
