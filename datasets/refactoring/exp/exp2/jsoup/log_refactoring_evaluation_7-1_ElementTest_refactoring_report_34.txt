asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original single test case has been split into three separate test cases, each focusing on a specific aspect of the `wrap` method:

1. **testWrap_SingleDiv**: Tests wrapping with a single div, equivalent to the first part of the original test.
2. **testWrap_NestedDivs**: Tests wrapping with nested divs, equivalent to the second part of the original test.
3. **testWrap_ReturnValue**: Tests the return value of the `wrap` method, equivalent to the third assertion in the original test.

Each refactored test case accurately reproduces the behavior and assertions of the corresponding parts of the original test. Therefore, the functionality is consistent.
