asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test performs three main checks:

1. Verifies that the initial clone matches the original document.
2. Verifies that modifications to the clone reflect the expected changes.
3. Verifies that the original document remains unchanged after cloning and modifying the clone.

The refactored version splits these checks into three separate test methods, each focusing on one specific aspect of the cloning and modification process. This approach enhances readability and maintainability without altering the underlying functionality or the assertions made.
