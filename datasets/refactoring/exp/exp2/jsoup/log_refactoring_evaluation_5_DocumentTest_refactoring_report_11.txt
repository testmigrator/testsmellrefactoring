asserts result:
 No, the tests are not consistent.

**Reasons for Inconsistency:**

**Redundant Assertion Commented Out**:
   - **Original Test**: `assertEquals(docA.hashCode(), docA.hashCode());`
   - **Refactored Test**: `// assertEquals(docA.hashCode(), docA.hashCode()); // Redundant assertion, commented out for clarity.`
   - **Inconsistency**: The original test includes a redundant assertion that checks if `docA`'s hash code is equal to itself, which is always true and thus unnecessary. The refactored test correctly comments out this redundant assertion.
