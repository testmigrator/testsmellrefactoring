Suppose you are a Java testing expert. You are given a set of test codes before and after refactoring (the refactored code may include multiple functions). Please evaluate:
Whether the functionality between them is consistent (ignoring the code dependencies outside of the functions, such as classes, fields, etc., which already exist in the complete test file).
Response format:
If they are consistent, simply reply with: “yes”
If they are not consistent, please indicate which Test is inconsistent, and provide a brief overview of the reasons for the inconsistency.
