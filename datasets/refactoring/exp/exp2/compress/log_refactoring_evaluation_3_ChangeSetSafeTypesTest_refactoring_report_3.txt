asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily to improve readability and clarity, such as using a named constant `EXPECTED_CHANGE_SIZE` and adding more descriptive error messages to the assertions. The core logic and behavior of the test remain unchanged.
