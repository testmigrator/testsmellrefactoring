asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The main changes include:
- Using `tempDir.createTempFile` instead of `createTempFile` to create the temporary file.
- Adding checks to ensure that the input files exist and are of the expected type before proceeding.
- Wrapping the try-with-resources block in an `assertDoesNotThrow` to handle any unexpected exceptions that might occur during the test execution.

These changes do not alter the core functionality of the test, which is to verify that adding an existing file with `replace=true` works correctly. The assertions and the overall structure of the test remain the same.
