asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily to improve readability and structure without altering the behavior of the test. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

1. **Method Extraction**: The `setupMockNewAttributeBands` method is extracted to encapsulate the creation of `MockNewAttributeBands`. This does not change the functionality but improves code organization.

2. **Type Safety**: The list type is explicitly defined as `List<LayoutElement>` in the refactored code, which is a good practice but does not affect the functionality.

3. **Enhanced Assertions**: The refactored code includes more detailed assertions with messages, which can help in debugging but do not change the core functionality of the test.

4. **Exception Handling**: The `setupMockNewAttributeBands` method now wraps any `IOException` in a `RuntimeException`, ensuring that the test fails if an exception occurs during setup. This is consistent with the original behavior, where the test would fail if an `IOException` was thrown.

Overall, the refactored code is functionally equivalent to the original test.
