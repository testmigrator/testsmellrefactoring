asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests cover all the assertions made in the original test method `testReplicationLayout`. Each aspect of the original test has been broken down into individual test methods, ensuring that the same checks are performed:

- The size of the layout elements (`testReplicationLayoutSize`).
- The tag of the count element (`testReplicationCountTag`).
- The size of the replicated elements (`testReplicatedElementsSize`).
- The tags of each of the replicated elements (`testFirstReplicatedElementTag`, `testSecondReplicatedElementTag`, `testThirdReplicatedElementTag`, `testFourthReplicatedElementTag`, `testFifthReplicatedElementTag`).

All these tests collectively ensure that the functionality remains consistent with the original test.
