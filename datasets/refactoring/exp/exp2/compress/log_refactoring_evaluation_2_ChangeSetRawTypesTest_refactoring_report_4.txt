asserts result: 
 No, the functionality is not consistent.

**Reasons for Inconsistency:**

1. **Entry Name Mismatch:**
   - In the original test, the second `ZipArchiveEntry` is created with the name `"test.txt"`.
   - In the refactored test, the second `ZipArchiveEntry` is also created with the name `"test.txt"`, but it should likely be `"test2.xml"` if the intention was to have a different entry name. This could lead to unexpected behavior or test failures if the entries are supposed to be distinct.

2. **Exception Handling:**
   - The original test does not explicitly handle exceptions; it assumes that no exceptions will be thrown.
   - The refactored test includes a try-catch block and uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure no exceptions are thrown. This adds an additional layer of exception handling that was not present in the original test.

3. **Assertion Messages:**
   - The refactored test includes detailed assertion messages, which were not present in the original test. While this is generally a good practice, it changes the behavior of the test by providing more context in case of failure.

To make the refactored test consistent with the original, you should:
- Ensure the second `ZipArchiveEntry` is created with the correct name (`"test2.xml"`).
- Remove the try-catch block and `assertDoesNotThrow` if you want to maintain the original behavior of not explicitly handling exceptions.
