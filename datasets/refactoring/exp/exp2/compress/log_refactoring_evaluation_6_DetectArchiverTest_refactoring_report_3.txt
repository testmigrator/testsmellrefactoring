asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. Both versions perform the same checks for different types of archive files, ensuring that the `ArchiveInputStream` is not null and is an instance of the expected type. The refactored version wraps each check in an `assertDoesNotThrow` method to handle exceptions, but this does not change the core functionality of the tests. The commented-out part for the TGZ archive remains unchanged, indicating that it is still not implemented in both versions.
