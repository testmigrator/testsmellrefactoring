asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each test case from the original `testMatches` method has been broken down into individual methods, each focusing on a specific scenario (e.g., testing even numbers in multiple arrays, single array, and single-dimensional array, and similarly for the number 5). The setup method `setupTestMatches()` is included but does not affect the test logic, as it is commented out and can be used for shared setup logic if needed. The assertions and the logic within each test method are consistent with the original test cases.
