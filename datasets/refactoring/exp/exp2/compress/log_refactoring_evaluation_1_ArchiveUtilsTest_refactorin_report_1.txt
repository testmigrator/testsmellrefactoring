asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each assertion from the original test has been split into separate test methods, but the conditions being tested and the expected outcomes remain the same. The setup method ensures that the `buffer1` and `buffer2` arrays are initialized correctly before each test, preserving the state required for the tests to function as intended.
