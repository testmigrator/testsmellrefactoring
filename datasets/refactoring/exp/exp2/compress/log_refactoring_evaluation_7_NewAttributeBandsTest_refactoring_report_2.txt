asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The changes made are primarily structural, breaking down the original single method into smaller, more focused methods. Each of these methods performs a specific part of the test:

1. `setupMockNewAttributeBands` initializes the `MockNewAttributeBands` object.
2. `assertLayoutElementCount` checks that the list of layout elements has exactly one element.
3. `assertIntegralTag` verifies that the tag of the integral element matches the provided layout string.

These changes do not alter the behavior or the assertions of the test, ensuring that the functionality remains consistent.
