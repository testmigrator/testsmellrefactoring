asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test `testToAsciiBytes` has been split into two separate tests:

1. `testToAsciiBytes_Conversion`: This test checks the ASCII byte conversion, which is equivalent to the first part of the original test.
2. `testToAsciiBytes_EqualityCheck`: This test checks the equality condition with invalid parameters, which is equivalent to the second part of the original test.

Both parts of the original test are now covered by the refactored tests, ensuring that the overall functionality remains consistent.
