asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored code maintains the same functionality as the original test. The primary changes include:

1. **Use of `@TempDir`**: The refactored code uses the `@TempDir` annotation to create a temporary directory, which is a common practice in modern testing frameworks to ensure that temporary files are properly managed and cleaned up.

2. **Additional Checks**: The refactored code includes additional checks to ensure that the temporary file and the required file (`test.txt`) exist before proceeding with the test. This improves the robustness of the test by catching potential issues early.

3. **Descriptive Assertion Messages**: The assertions in the refactored code now include clear descriptive messages, which can help in debugging if the test fails.

These changes do not alter the core functionality of the test, which is to verify that an existing file is not replaced when `replace` is set to `false`. Therefore, the functionality remains consistent.
