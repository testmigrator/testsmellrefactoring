asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The primary changes include:

1. Wrapping the entire test body in an `assertDoesNotThrow` block to ensure that any unexpected exceptions are caught and reported.
2. Adding detailed messages to the `assertTrue` assertions to provide clearer feedback on what was expected when an assertion fails.

These changes do not alter the core logic or the expected outcomes of the test. Therefore, the functionality remains consistent.
