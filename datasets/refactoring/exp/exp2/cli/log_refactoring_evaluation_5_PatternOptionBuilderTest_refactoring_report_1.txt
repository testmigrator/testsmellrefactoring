asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The refactored test uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure that no exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test, which is a reasonable addition to verify that the test runs without unexpected errors. However, this does not change the core assertions or the behavior of the test itself. The assertions for `line.getOptionObject("c")` and `line.getOptionObject("d")` remain the same, ensuring that the test still checks the same conditions as the original.
