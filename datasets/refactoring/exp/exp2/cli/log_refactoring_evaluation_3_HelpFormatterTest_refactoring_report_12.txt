asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The only change is the separation of the test into two methods, `testPrintHelpWithNullSyntax` and `testPrintHelpWithEmptyStringSyntax`, each focusing on a specific case (null and empty string, respectively). The `setupTestPrintHelpWithEmptySyntax` method is used to initialize the `HelpFormatter` object, but it does not affect the actual assertions being made. Therefore, the functionality remains consistent.
