asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. The primary changes include wrapping the test logic inside an `assertDoesNotThrow` block to ensure that no unexpected exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test, and explicitly naming the expected number of arguments (`expectedNumberOfArgs`). These changes do not alter the core assertions or the behavior of the test.
