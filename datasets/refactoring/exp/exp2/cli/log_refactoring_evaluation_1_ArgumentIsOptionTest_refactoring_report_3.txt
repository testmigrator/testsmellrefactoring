asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The refactored test includes an `assertDoesNotThrow` method to ensure that no exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test, but this does not change the core assertions and logic of the test. All the original checks are still performed in the refactored version, ensuring that the behavior remains the same.
