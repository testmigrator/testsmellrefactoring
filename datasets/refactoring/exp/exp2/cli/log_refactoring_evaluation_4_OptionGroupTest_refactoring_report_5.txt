asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test maintains the same functionality as the original test. Both tests:

1. Set up the same input arguments `{"--file", "--directory"}`.
2. Expect an `AlreadySelectedException` to be thrown when `parser.parse(options, args)` is called.
3. Assert that the `getOptionGroup()` method of the exception returns a non-null value.
4. Assert that the `isSelected()` method of the option group returns `true`.
5. Assert that the `getSelected()` method of the option group returns `"f"`.
6. Assert that the `getOpt()` method of the option returns `"d"`.

The only difference is the use of `assertThrows` in the refactored test, which is a more modern and concise way to test for exceptions in JUnit 5, compared to the try-catch block in the original test. This change does not affect the consistency of the test's functionality.
