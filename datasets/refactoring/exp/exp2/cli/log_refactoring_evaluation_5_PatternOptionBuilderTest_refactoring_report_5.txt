asserts result: 
 The functionality between the original and refactored tests is **not consistent**. Here's a brief overview of the reasons for the inconsistency:

1. **Exception Handling**:
   - The original test does not explicitly handle exceptions.
   - The refactored test uses `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure that no unexpected exceptions occur during the test execution.

These changes alter the expected behavior of the test, making the refactored test check for different conditions than the original test. Therefore, the functionality is not consistent.
