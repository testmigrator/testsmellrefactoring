asserts result: 
 yes

The functionality between the original and refactored tests is consistent. The refactored test includes an additional assertion to ensure that no unexpected exceptions occur during parsing, but this does not change the core functionality being tested. All other assertions are equivalent, checking the presence and value of options 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
