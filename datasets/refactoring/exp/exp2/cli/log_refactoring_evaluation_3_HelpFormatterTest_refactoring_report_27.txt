asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. Each case from the original `testRtrim` method has been split into its own test method (`testRtrim_Null`, `testRtrim_EmptyString`, `testRtrim_Whitespace`), and each test method correctly sets up the `HelpFormatter` instance and performs the same assertions. The only difference is the addition of descriptive messages to the assertions, which does not affect the functionality.
