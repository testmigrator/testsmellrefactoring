asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored tests is consistent. The refactored version splits the original single test into two separate tests (`testRegister_DefaultConverter` and `testRegister_CustomConverter`), each focusing on a specific aspect of the `testRegister` method. The setup logic is moved to a helper method `setupTestRegister`, which initializes the `TypeHandler` and the map. Both refactored tests perform the same assertions as the original test, ensuring that the behavior remains unchanged.
