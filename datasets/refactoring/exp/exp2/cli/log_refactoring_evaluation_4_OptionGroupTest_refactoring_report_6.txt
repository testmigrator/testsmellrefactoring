asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. The refactored version wraps the entire test body in an `assertDoesNotThrow` block to ensure that no unexpected exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test. This change does not alter the behavior or the assertions being made; it only adds an additional layer of safety to catch any potential exceptions that might occur, which were previously unhandled in the original test. All the assertions and checks remain the same, ensuring that the test still verifies the same conditions.
