asserts result: 
 Yes

The refactored test code maintains the same functionality as the original test code. The only change is the addition of `assertDoesNotThrow` to ensure that no unexpected exceptions are thrown during the execution of the test. This does not alter the core assertions or the behavior of the test itself.
