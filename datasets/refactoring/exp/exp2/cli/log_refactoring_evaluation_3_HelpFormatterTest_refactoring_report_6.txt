 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original single test has been split into three separate tests, each focusing on a specific part of the functionality:

1. **testHelpWithLongOptSeparator_DefaultSeparator**: This checks that the default long option separator is correctly set to `--`.
2. **testHelpWithLongOptSeparator_SetSeparator**: This verifies that the long option separator can be set to a custom value (`=` in this case).
3. **testHelpWithLongOptSeparator_PrintHelp**: This tests the actual output of the help message, ensuring it matches the expected format with the correct long option separator.

The refactored code also includes helper methods to reduce redundancy and improve readability, but the overall functionality remains consistent with the original test.
