asserts result: 
 no

**Reasons for Inconsistency:**
- The original test `testnstantiableEquals` contains an assertion that checks if two instances of `Instantiable` are equal using `assertEquals`.
- In the refactored version, this assertion has been commented out, effectively removing the test's functionality. This means the refactored test no longer verifies the equality of two `Instantiable` objects, making it inconsistent with the original test.
