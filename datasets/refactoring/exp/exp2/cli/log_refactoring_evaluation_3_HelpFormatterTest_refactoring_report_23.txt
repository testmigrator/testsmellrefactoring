asserts result: 
 yes

The refactored tests maintain the same functionality as the original test. The original test checks both the correct rendering of wrapped text and the exception handling within a single method. The refactored version splits these into two separate methods:

1. `testRenderWrappedTextSingleLine_TextRendering` focuses on verifying that the text is rendered correctly.
2. `testRenderWrappedTextSingleLine_ExceptionHandling` focuses on verifying that an `UncheckedIOException` is thrown when `appendWrappedText` throws an `IOException`.

Both aspects are still being tested, and the functionality remains consistent.
