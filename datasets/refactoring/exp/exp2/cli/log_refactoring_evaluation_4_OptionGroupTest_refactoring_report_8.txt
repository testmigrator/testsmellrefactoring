asserts result: 
 Yes

The functionality between the original test and the refactored test is consistent. Both tests:

1. Set up an array of command-line arguments `{"-f"}`.
2. Create a `Properties` object and add a property `"d"` with the value `"true"`.
3. Parse the command-line arguments using the provided options and properties.
4. Assert that the parsed command line has the option `"f"`.
5. Assert that the parsed command line does not have the option `"d"`.

The only difference is the use of `assertDoesNotThrow` in the refactored test, which ensures that no unexpected exceptions are thrown during the parsing process. This does not change the core functionality of the test.
