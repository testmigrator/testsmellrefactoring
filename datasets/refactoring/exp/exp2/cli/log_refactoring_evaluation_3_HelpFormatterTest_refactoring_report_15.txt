asserts result: 
 No, the functionality is not consistent.

**Reasons for Inconsistency:**

1. **Variable Scope Issue:**
   - In the original test, the `StringWriter out` is declared and used within the same method, ensuring that it is accessible when the assertion is made.
   - In the refactored code, `StringWriter out` is declared in the `setupTestPrintOptionWithEmptyArgNameUsage` method but is not accessible in the `testPrintOptionWithEmptyArgNameUsage_UsageOutput` method. This will result in a compilation error or a runtime error if `out` is not declared as an instance variable or passed as a parameter.

2. **Assertion Failure:**
   - The assertion in the refactored test (`assertEquals(expectedOutput, actualOutput);`) will fail because `actualOutput` is not defined in the scope of the test method. The `out` variable from the `setupTestPrintOptionWithEmptyArgNameUsage` method is not available in the test method.

To make the refactored code consistent with the original, you need to ensure that the `StringWriter out` is properly scoped and accessible in the test method. One way to do this is to declare `out` as an instance variable:

```java
private StringWriter out;

private void setupTestPrintOptionWithEmptyArgNameUsage() {
    final Option option = new Option("f", true, null);
    option.setArgName("");
    option.setRequired(true);

    final Options options = new Options();
    options.addOption(option);

    out = new StringWriter();

    final HelpFormatter formatter = new HelpFormatter();
    formatter.printUsage(new PrintWriter(out), 80, "app", options);
}

@Test
public void testPrintOptionWithEmptyArgNameUsage_UsageOutput() {
    setupTestPrintOptionWithEmptyArgNameUsage();

    String expectedOutput = "usage: app -f" + EOL;
    String actualOutput = out.toString();
    assertEquals(expectedOutput, actualOutput);
}
```

This ensures that the `out` variable is accessible in the test method, making the functionality consistent with the original test.
